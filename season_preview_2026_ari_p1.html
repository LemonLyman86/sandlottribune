    <h1>2026 TSDL Season Preview: Arizona Diamondbacks</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Joel Sherman &mdash; 2026-02-22 &mdash; 12 min read &mdash; Part 1 of 2</p>
  </div>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Champions</span>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Nobody picked the <strong>Arizona Diamondbacks</strong> to win the 2025 TSDL championship. They stumbled into October as the 8th seed — the last team through the door — with an 11-8 record that looked like a polite invitation rather than a championship credential. <strong>Cote Nichols</strong> had other ideas.</p>

    <div class="stat-item"><span class="stat-label">Active Keepers</span><span class="stat-value">20</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>What followed the regular season was one of the most impressive postseason runs in TSDL history. Arizona dismantled Atlanta's #1 seed in the Divisional round. They edged Las Vegas — the #2 seed — by 34 points in a two-week Conference Series thriller. They closed out St. Louis in the Championship by 41.5. Three rounds, three wins, zero losses. The eighth seed was the last team standing.</p>

  <p>It caps a remarkable — and uneven — four-year arc. In 2022, the Diamondbacks went 16-2, dominated the regular season, and lost in the finals. In 2023 and 2024, they missed the playoffs entirely, bottoming out at 7-12 and 16th place in a league of 18 in 2024. Then everything clicked. The farm system delivered, the pitching staff peaked, and a consciously balanced roster proved to be exactly the formula that wins a championship when it matters most.</p>

  <p>Arizona now enters 2026 as defending champions with 44 career wins, a 58.7% all-time winning percentage, and four playoff appearances in four seasons. The question isn't whether this franchise belongs among the TSDL elite — that case was made in October. The question is whether the machine Nichols built can keep running as contracts escalate, auction budget tightens to $34, and every opponent circles the calendar to circle them first.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">2025 Campaign</span>
  <h2>2025 In-Season Moves</h2>

  <p>The 2025 campaign began where every dynasty season should: at the draft table. The MiLB slow draft happens before Opening Day, and Arizona — picking 9th out of 18 teams in each round — made five new picks and retained five players already in the system.</p>

  <p>The headline selection was <strong>Nick Kurtz</strong> at Round 1, Pick 9. That draft pick aged extraordinarily well in real time: Kurtz went on to play 117 games in 2025 and posted 428.5 fantasy points — more production than most active roster players on a third of the teams in this league. Picking him 9th overall was, in retrospect, one of the best draft decisions in the TSDL that season.</p>

  <p>Round 2 brought <strong>Braden Montgomery</strong>, a 22-year-old outfield prospect with sharply split evaluations from major scouting systems. One has him as a top-20 prospect; another doesn't place him in the top 50. That kind of disagreement is either a buy signal on a real developmental inflection point or a warning sign about a murky profile. Arizona's Round 2 conviction makes their internal read clear. Round 3 produced <strong>Emiliano Teodo</strong> (25, RHP), a deep lottery-ticket arm. Round 4 delivered <strong>Luke Keaschall</strong> (23), who flashed legitimate production later in the year with 168.5 FPts in 49 games. Round 5 added <strong>Alex Freeland</strong> (24, SP), a consensus top-165 prospect and organizational depth piece.</p>

  <p>Retained in the system without using draft slots: <strong>Luis Morales, Kyle Manzardo, Samuel Basallo, Ben Joyce</strong>, and <strong>Robby Snelling</strong>. Each of those five adds a distinct layer to one of the richest farm systems in the TSDL — more on that in Part 2.</p>

  <p>The 2025 Free Agent Auction told a simple story: Arizona didn't need much. Total auction spending was <strong>$51</strong> — frugal by any measure, and entirely appropriate when your existing roster is already producing. The message wasn't budget hoarding; it was roster confidence.</p>

  <p>The headline buy was <strong>Max Scherzer</strong> at $21, a veteran starter brought in for a single-season rental. He pitched, he contributed, he was released. <strong>Spencer Torkelson</strong> came aboard at $8 and vastly exceeded expectations: 416.5 FPts across 155 games, now a locked-in 2026 keeper at $9 in Year 2. That $8 investment will pay dividends for at least two more seasons. <strong>Jhonkensy Noel</strong> ($10) and <strong>Tyler Fitzgerald</strong> ($9) were developmental bets that didn't earn 2026 roster spots. <strong>Josh Bell</strong> rounded the auction out at $3.</p>

  <p>In April, Nichols made the one significant in-season trade: <strong>Josh Jung</strong> ($5, Year 3) and <strong>Jordan Romano</strong> went to Philadelphia in exchange for <strong>Alex Call</strong> and <strong>Devin Williams</strong> ($12, Year 4). Williams gave Arizona a reliable bullpen presence for the stretch run. Neither he nor Call ended up on the 2026 roster — this was a rental move executed cleanly, without sacrificing long-term assets.</p>

  <p>The real story of 2025 in-season activity was the waiver wire. Arizona ran 168 FAAB transactions totaling $316 in spending. The most important $2 in the entire league went to <strong>Trevor Megill</strong>, claimed on April 17. In the 50 games that followed, Megill posted 342.0 fantasy points at 6.8 FPts per game. That's not a lucky streamer; that's a bullpen cornerstone who fell through the cracks of every other team's scouting and landed in Cote Nichols' hands at the best possible moment. He's still on the 2026 roster, and the question of what to do with him is one of the more interesting decisions of this offseason.</p>

  <p>The overall in-season approach — disciplined auction, targeted trade, dominant waiver work — is exactly the template of a championship operation. <strong>Season Strategy Grade: <span class="grade">A&minus;</span></strong></p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Season Analysis</span>
  <h2>2025 Season in Review</h2>

  <p>The 2025 Arizona Diamondbacks were not a dominant regular season team. They were a very good one that saved their best for last.</p>

  <p>They opened the year 4-0, briefly sitting atop the power rankings through Week 4 — a hot start that suggested a wire-to-wire campaign might be possible. Then the wobble came. Three consecutive losses in Weeks 5, 6, and 7 revealed a team that was inconsistent rather than elite. From there, Arizona settled into a range they'd occupy for most of the regular season: 7th to 9th, competitive without being commanding, accumulating wins without ever threatening the top tier.</p>

  <div class="stat-grid">
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Hitting FPts:</strong> 4,062.0<br><span style="color:#666;font-size:0.9em">League Avg: 3,584.5</span></div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Pitching FPts:</strong> 3,924.5<br><span style="color:#666;font-size:0.9em">League Avg: 3,098.9</span></div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Total FPts:</strong> 7,986.5<br><span style="color:#666;font-size:0.9em">League Avg: 6,683.4</span></div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>FPts/Game:</strong> 4.3<br><span style="color:#666;font-size:0.9em">League Avg: 3.9</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The underlying numbers told a different story than the middling standings position. Arizona finished well above league average in both hitting and pitching — 4,062.0 hitting FPts (league average: 3,584.5) and 3,924.5 pitching FPts (league average: 3,098.9). The 50.9/49.1 hit-pitch split is the hallmark of a deliberately balanced roster construction. No categories left exposed, no overdependence on a single skill set that opposing rosters can target. The offense posted <strong>268 HR, 824 RBI, 742 R, and 77 SB</strong>. The pitching staff accumulated <strong>1,506.1 IP, 98 W, 30 SV, 103 QS, and 1,476 K</strong>.</p>

  <p>A few schedule notes worth flagging: Arizona suffered its two worst weeks against Atlanta (Week 5, down 135 points) and Houston (Week 6, down 107). Those are legitimate beatdowns against the league's best teams. They also lost a gut-punch 0.5-point decision to Las Vegas in Week 15 — arguably the most painful week of their season, a half-point away from 10-5 instead of 9-6. The margin between good and great in regular season TSDL is often razor-thin, and ARI lived in that space all year.</p>

  <p>They finished 11-8, claimed the 8th seed by the barest of margins, and then completely changed what the season meant.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">"They beat the 1-seed, the 2-seed, and the 4-seed on the way to the title. Not one of those matchups was particularly close. Nobody saw it coming — which, if you've been paying attention to Cote Nichols since 2022, means you weren't paying close enough attention."</blockquote>

  <p>The Divisional Series against Atlanta: <strong>ARI 749.5, ATL 563</strong>. A 186.5-point margin over two weeks against the team that finished 16-3 in the regular season. Not close. The Conference Series against Las Vegas: <strong>ARI 762, LVA 728</strong>. A 34-point margin against the league's #2 seed over two weeks — a genuine battle that Arizona won on the strength of its rotation. The Championship against St. Louis: <strong>ARI 577.5, STL 536</strong>. A 41.5-point victory to close it out.</p>

  <p>Three rounds, three wins. The 8th seed won the title, and they earned every single game of it.</p>

  <p>The best individual story of the season was the one that cost the least. <strong>Trevor Megill</strong> — $2 on the waiver wire April 17 — delivered 342.0 FPts in his half-season with the club, the most valuable FAAB return in the league. He remains on the roster heading into 2026, and that storyline is far from over.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Roster Moves</span>
  <h2>Offseason Roster Cuts</h2>

  <p>Three players were released from the 2025 roster entering 2026: <strong>Chase Meidroth, Yoan Moncada</strong>, and <strong>Matt Brash</strong>. The common thread connecting all three is a $1 contract in Year 1 — standard tryout-tier pieces who didn't earn a renewal.</p>

  <p>Meidroth was the closest call, posting a respectable 260.0 FPts. In another organization, that production might buy a second look. Here, with 20 quality players already locked in, it didn't. Moncada managed 186.5 FPts — veteran production at the end of the line, not enough to justify even a $2 salary. Brash delivered 190.5 FPts as a reliever with limited upside for the future. None of the three carried injury or suspension context; these were clean, uncomplicated production decisions.</p>

  <p>There is no controversy buried in these releases, no regret-worthy franchise player left on the table. The more notable aspect of this offseason isn't who was cut — it's how few cuts were made. Three players. That's it. A defending championship roster that needed almost nothing changed is a franchise operating at the height of its confidence. The D-backs have no interest in tinkering with something that just worked.</p>

  <p>The questions entering 2026 belong not to the players who left, but to the contracts that stayed — and to the $34 auction budget that will determine whether this team adds its missing piece or enters the season with a gaping hole at shortstop. That story begins in Part 2.</p>
