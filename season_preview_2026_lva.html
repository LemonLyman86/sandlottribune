    <figcaption>Las Vegas Athletics — Season History</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>There are teams that take years to build. And then there's <strong>Mike DiMauro</strong>.</p>

  <p>The Las Vegas Athletics arrived in the TSDL two seasons ago and immediately set about rewriting every expectation the league had for an expansion franchise. No patient rebuild. No developmental seasons. No respectful losing while the roster caught up to the ambition. DiMauro came in, spent precisely, traded aggressively, and within twelve months had himself a championship ring. He came back in 2025 and did nearly the same thing again — 15 wins, 4 losses, the second seed, the Silver Slugger Award — except this time the ring went somewhere else, to an Arizona Diamondbacks team that backed into the postseason as the eighth seed and ran the table on everyone in their path.</p>

  <p>The final math of 2025, distilled to its cruelest form: LVA lost the conference finals by 34 points. Arizona went on to win the championship. LVA won three of their four regular-season meetings with Arizona, including a 346-to-345.5 squeaker in Week 15 and a 255-point blowout in the 3rd place consolation game. In the one matchup that mattered — the one played in the right two-week window — the Athletics fell short by the slimmest margin of any game they played all year.</p>

  <p>So here is the question that frames the entire 2026 preview: can the best team in the TSDL that hasn't won back-to-back championships become the team that finally does? The talent says yes. The salary structure says it's complicated.</p>

  </div>

  <span class="section-kicker">In-Season Activity</span>
  <h2>Building While Winning: 2025 In-Season Activity</h2>

  <p>The 2025 TSDL calendar began, as it always does, with the MiLB slow draft — and DiMauro arrived at pick #17 with a decided advantage: five prospects already locked into the system from the prior year's draft. <strong>Max Clark</strong>, <strong>Jackson Jobe</strong>, <strong>Emmanuel Rodriguez</strong>, <strong>Heston Kjerstad</strong>, and <strong>Thomas White</strong> were all retained without burning a pick, meaning LVA's five actual draft selections could be used to add genuine new talent rather than re-stocking a depleted farm. DiMauro used that luxury well. His first-round pick was <strong>Felnin Celesten</strong>, a projectable 20-year-old with a significant scouting split between major services — the kind of volatile prospect you draft late in the first round precisely because the uncertainty is priced in. Rounds two through five added <strong>Jaison Chourio</strong>, <strong>George Klassen</strong>, <strong>Ralphy Velazquez</strong>, and <strong>Emil Morales</strong>, five names that represent a significant bet on upside over immediate impact.</p>

  <p>The FA auction was quiet — deliberately so. With a roster that had won a championship the prior season and retained most of its core, DiMauro had no gaping holes to fill and no reason to engage in a bidding war for players who represented marginal upgrades. He spent just $70 of his available budget. The headline acquisition was <strong>Manny Machado</strong> at $34 — an expensive bet on a third baseman who proceeded to play 159 games and post 486.5 fantasy points, making the price look reasonable in retrospect. He also grabbed <strong>Shane Bieber</strong> ($6) as rotation depth, <strong>Ryan Jeffers</strong> ($2) as a backup catcher, <strong>Jason Adam</strong> ($2) as bullpen filler, and <strong>Marcus Semien</strong> ($23) — though Semien would barely last a month before being flipped for value.</p>

  <p>The real story of the 2025 Athletics, however, was written across a frantic two-week stretch in May that may be the most consequential trade sequence in TSDL history. DiMauro opened the window in mid-April with a pair of surgical moves: shipping the aging, expensive <strong>Aaron Nola</strong> ($31) to Chicago for <strong>Riley Greene</strong> ($12) and Erick Fedde, and trading Semien to Philadelphia for <strong>Reese Olson</strong> ($6). Both deals dumped salary and acquired assets. That was the prelude.</p>

  <p>On May 9, DiMauro executed the first phase of the master plan: a blockbuster with Boston that landed <strong>Carlos Rodon</strong> ($16, Year 4) and <strong>Rafael Devers</strong> ($49) in exchange for Klassen, <strong>Luis Garcia</strong>, Riley Greene, and Hayden Wesneski. Rodon at $16 for a legitimate frontline starter was an extraordinary price. Devers, meanwhile, was never the destination. He was the currency.</p>

  <p>Two days later: Devers and Spencer Steer went to Cincinnati. Back came <strong>Luis Gil</strong> and, the centerpiece, <strong>Juan Soto</strong> at $90 (Year 3). Soto at ninety dollars. No other owner in the league would have touched it. DiMauro touched it, and Soto responded with 661.5 fantasy points in 160 games — the second-best individual performance on the team and one of the finest single-season totals in the league. He was always a rental by design; the 2026 escalation to $95 makes him impossible to retain. But for one season, DiMauro had assembled the most dangerous lineup in the TSDL, and everyone knew it.</p>

  <p>The sequence concluded on May 19: Luis Gil, Heston Kjerstad, and Jaison Chourio went to Boston in exchange for <strong>Logan Gilbert</strong> ($16, Year 4) — a durable innings-eater who gave the rotation a third legitimate starter at a below-market rate. Three weeks of maneuvering had added Rodon, Soto, and Gilbert. It was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The August deadline added two more moves that look even better in hindsight. Cincinnati sent <strong>Jacob deGrom</strong> to Las Vegas in exchange for the trivial price of Lawrence Butler ($2) — possibly the most lopsided arm-for-player deal of the season. deGrom responded with 477.5 fantasy points across 30 starts. DiMauro also pried <strong>Ivan Herrera</strong>, <strong>Bryan Reynolds</strong>, and prospect <strong>Emil Morales</strong> away from Philadelphia, trading Thomas White, Kerry Carpenter, and Ryan Jeffers in return.</p>

  <p>The in-season strategy grade is not a question. <span class="grade">A</span></p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Season Review</span>
  <h2>15–4, Again: The 2025 Season in Review</h2>

  <p>Repeat after me: 15-4. Fifteen wins. Four losses. For the second consecutive season, DiMauro's Athletics finished with the exact same record and the exact same seeding — second in the league, behind only the Braves. Back-to-back Silver Slugger Awards. Back-to-back top-two finishes. A franchise that has been in existence for two seasons and has never finished outside the top two. The consistency is either reassuring or maddening, depending on which side of the ledger you're reading.</p>

  <p>The offensive engine was dominant. LVA posted 4,800.0 hitting fantasy points — the best mark in the league and a 242-point improvement over their already-elite 2024 total. <strong>Aaron Judge</strong> led the entire league with 693.0 FPts across 152 games. <strong>Juan Soto</strong> was right behind him at 661.5 in 160 games, a 4.1-points-per-game pace that made the inevitable offseason departure genuinely painful. <strong>Francisco Lindor</strong> played all 160 games and delivered 574.5 FPts. <strong>Corbin Carroll</strong> was a force for 551.5 in 143 games. The lineup had no weak spots from top to bottom, and the Silver Slugger hardware reflected it.</p>

  <div class="stat-grid">
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Hitting FPts:</strong> 4,800.0<br><em>League Rank: #1 — Silver Slugger</em></div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Pitching FPts:</strong> 3,726.5<br><em>106 W, 59 SV, 133 QS, 1,722 K</em></div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>HR / RBI / SB:</strong> 271 / 818 / 181<br><em>Power, production, and speed</em></div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>FPts/G vs. League Avg:</strong> 4.4 vs. 3.9<br><em>+13% above league mean</em></div>
  </div>

  <p>The pitching staff was nearly as impressive. <strong>Carlos Rodon</strong> delivered 541.5 points in 33 starts (16.4 FPts/G), the best per-game rate on the roster. <strong>Jacob deGrom</strong>, in the final stretch after the August acquisition, went 477.5 points in 30 starts. <strong>Joe Ryan</strong> was steady and available all year — 439.0 FPts across 31 outings. The bullpen featured a pair of elite closers in <strong>Raisel Iglesias</strong> (353.5 in 70 games) and <strong>Kenley Jansen</strong> (349.5 in 62), giving the team a reliable late-inning combination that most opponents couldn't match.</p>

  <p>The weekly arc traced a team that started slow, found its footing fast, and never really fell off. After a Week 1 loss to Seattle (395–458.5), LVA rattled off six straight wins and climbed to the top of the power rankings by Week 5. A mid-season stumble — Week 11's 207-point disaster against St. Louis, followed by a 1-point loss to Atlanta (267–268) — could have been the season's inflection point. Instead, the Athletics won six of their final seven regular season games, closing with authority and claiming the #2 seed going into the postseason.</p>

  <p>The divisional round was clean: a 725.5-to-614.5 win over Toronto. Then came the conference finals. LVA put up 728 points against Arizona — more than enough to beat nearly any team in the field on any given fortnight. Arizona put up 762. The season ended with a number DiMauro will not soon forget: 34. Thirty-four points. The margin between a conference finals exit and a championship series appearance, between a third-place finish and a second ring.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">Arizona went on to win the championship as the eighth seed. In four regular season and consolation matchups, LVA went 3-1 against them — including a blowout 3rd place win by 255 points. In the one game that defined the season, they lost by 34.</blockquote>

  <p>The consolation victory over Seattle (739.5–484) was dominant enough to feel meaningful in a vacuum. In context, it was just a reminder of what LVA is capable of when the bracket hasn't already broken their heart.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Offseason</span>
  <h2>What They Let Go</h2>

  <p>For a 17-man roster that ran through one of the most successful seasons in league history, the official cut list is admirably brief. <strong>Landen Roupp</strong> is the lone confirmed release — a right-handed starter who posted 203 fantasy points in 22 starts at a 9.2 FPts/G clip that would make most teams think twice before letting him go. But DiMauro has a crowded rotation and a budget problem that turns even reasonable contracts into luxuries. Roupp at $5 for Year 3 was the logical trim: sixth or seventh in the depth chart, adequate rather than indispensable, not worth the slot when every roster position is under scrutiny.</p>

  <p>The more significant subtraction is the one that happened without a press release: <strong>Juan Soto</strong> will not be back. The $90 outfielder was always a rental — DiMauro acquired him knowing the 2026 escalation to $95 (Year 4) would make him impossible to keep — but a player who produced 661.5 fantasy points in a single season doesn't quietly vanish. He walks out the door and into the most coveted slot in the 2026 free agent auction. His absence isn't just a roster loss; it's a structural fact that will define how every team approaches the bidding room in March.</p>

  <p>The core remains largely intact. The salary structure does not. What's left after Roupp's cut and Soto's departure is a roster of extraordinary talent at escalating cost — a machine built to win now that has begun to price itself out of flexibility. DiMauro built this thing to contend, and it does. The 2026 season will test whether he can maintain contender status while simultaneously managing the heaviest payroll burden in the league.</p>

  <p>The window is still open. The question is how many more offseasons it can stay that way before the salary math forces a reckoning.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Roster</span>
  <h2>The Core — Returning Players</h2>

  <p>Strip away the budget concerns for a moment and look at what Mike DiMauro is bringing back. This is a roster anchored by one of the best outfielders alive, a generational shortstop, a legitimate ace, and a supporting cast that would be the envy of most teams in the league. The 2026 Athletics are not a team in decline. They are a team at peak power confronting a structural problem that their talent cannot fully solve on its own.</p>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Aaron Judge</div>
    <div class="player-meta">OF | 2026 Cost: $44 | Contract Year 6</div>
    <p>The anchor, the franchise, the reason. Judge led the entire TSDL with 693.0 FPts across 152 games — 4.6 points per game at a rate that makes even a $44 keeper cost look reasonable. He enters Year 6, and the question of when his salary outlasts his production is theoretical for now. At $44, he's the most expensive player on the roster and arguably worth every dollar of it. There is no version of this team that drops Aaron Judge.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Francisco Lindor</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SS | 2026 Cost: $39 | Contract Year 6</div>
    <p>Lindor played every game in 2025 — all 160 — and produced 574.5 FPts (3.6 FPts/G). At $39 entering Year 6, he is unambiguously expensive for a shortstop. He is also one of the most durable, consistent players in the league, and shortstop depth at this level is essentially nonexistent in the free agent pool. You pay the premium or you play without a star at short. DiMauro pays the premium.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Corbin Carroll</div>
    <div class="player-meta">OF | 2026 Cost: $15 | Contract Year 5</div>
    <p>The best contract value on the roster, possibly in the league. Carroll posted 551.5 FPts in 143 games at $10 in 2025 — that's 55.2 FPts per dollar, an efficiency number that makes accountants weep with joy. At $15 entering Year 5, he remains a franchise-level bargain. Dynamic speed-and-power profile, young, durable. If Judge is the alpha, Carroll is the reason this offense has a ceiling even a dominant ace can't suppress.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Jacob deGrom</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP | 2026 Cost: $36 | Contract Year 4</div>
    <p>Acquired for Lawrence Butler ($2) in what may be remembered as the steal of the 2025 season, deGrom returned 477.5 FPts in 30 starts — 15.9 FPts/G, which is elite frontline territory. The caveat is always the same with deGrom: he's only as good as his availability, and his career has been defined by dominant stretches punctuated by extended absences. At $36, the risk is real but the reward is a legitimate ace. If he gives LVA 28 starts in 2026, this is one of the best keeper values in the league.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The supporting cast is deep and genuinely strong. <strong>Gunnar Henderson</strong> ($11, Year 4) is arguably the best value play on the entire roster outside of Carroll: 461.5 FPts at $11, SS-eligible, with a contract that remains team-friendly for multiple seasons. He plays above his salary at every level of analysis. <strong>Carlos Rodon</strong> ($26, Year 6) remains a legitimate ace — 541.5 FPts, 16.4 FPts/G in 33 starts — though at Year 6 and climbing, the long-term math on a declining-years starter deserves honest evaluation. <strong>Joe Ryan</strong> ($21, Year 6) is a durable mid-rotation workhorse: 439.0 FPts in 31 starts, reliably available and reliably productive.</p>

  <p><strong>Manny Machado</strong> ($38, Year 3) is the roster's most ambiguous keeper. His 2025 production (486.5 FPts, 159 games) is solid, and he plays every day without complaint. But $38 for a third baseman heading into Year 3 — a player whose best days as a long-term dynasty asset are likely behind him — is a significant commitment. Not wrong, not indefensible, but worth monitoring as the salary clock keeps ticking. <strong>Tyler Soderstrom</strong> ($10, Year 4) hit 437.5 FPts in 158 games and brings 1B/OF positional flexibility. At $10, he's comfortable depth. <strong>Kenley Jansen</strong> ($10, Year 3) posted 349.5 FPts in 62 appearances — solid closing production at a manageable price, though closer volatility is always a concern in dynasty formats.</p>

  <p>And then there's the salary reality, which doesn't wait for anyone. The 2025 roster carried $249 in active salary. After the annual escalation built into every keeper contract, the 2026 projected total climbs to <strong>$322</strong> — sixty-two dollars above the $260 auction cap. That means DiMauro enters the free agent auction with a negative budget unless he makes meaningful preemptive cuts. This is not a rounding error or a minor inconvenience. It is the dominant strategic fact of the entire offseason, and every decision between now and March 22 flows from it.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">The 2026 keeper salary escalates to $322 — $62 over the auction cap. The most dominant roster in the TSDL is also its most financially constrained. DiMauro must cut to compete at the auction table, and the players available to cut are not easy decisions.</blockquote>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Minors</span>
  <h2>Farm Report — Minor League Roster</h2>

  <p>Here is where the LVA story gets genuinely interesting, where the short-term salary pressure gives way to a long-term picture that should make every other owner in the league uncomfortable: Mike DiMauro has assembled one of the best minor league systems in the TSDL, and he's done it while simultaneously running one of the best MLB rosters in the league. The farm isn't a consolation prize for a team that couldn't compete. It's a supplemental asset for a team that already can.</p>

  <p><strong>Max Clark</strong> (OF, 21) is the centerpiece. Ranked as a consensus top-10 prospect in baseball by the major scouting services — with one system placing him as high as sixth overall — Clark represents the kind of generational talent that shifts a franchise's ceiling upward the moment he arrives. He hasn't debuted yet. He will. When he does, he arrives as a potential cornerstone outfielder at the most valuable position in fantasy baseball. At $0 salary on the MiLB roster, he's not helping LVA win in 2026. In 2027 and beyond, he could be the reason they're still winning. The long-term stash grade is as high as it gets.</p>

  <p><strong>Jackson Jobe</strong> (SP, 23) is a different case entirely — the most immediately relevant piece in the system. Jobe already made his MLB debut in 2025, accumulating 97.5 fantasy points in 10 major league games. At 23, with MLB experience and the stuff that has kept scouts buzzing for two years, he's essentially ready. The question DiMauro must answer before March 15 is whether to activate Jobe to the active roster — gaining a potential ace-caliber starter at $0 in 2026 — or keep him in the MiLB slot for another year of roster flexibility. Given the salary crisis on the active side, promoting Jobe now could be one of the most impactful moves LVA makes this offseason. A legitimate rotation arm at zero cost doesn't come along often.</p>

  <p><strong>Emmanuel Rodriguez</strong> (OF, 22) is the system's third-best piece and a consensus top-60 prospect, with one major scouting service ranking him inside the top 50. The 22-year-old outfielder has the tools to develop into an above-average regular, with the typical uncertainty of an upper-minors bat still rounding into form. He's not ready for 2026 in any immediate sense, but he's the kind of player who makes a franchise feel secure about its outfield pipeline even as Judge and Carroll age on the active side.</p>

  <p><strong>Emil Morales</strong> (19) arrived via the August trade with Philadelphia and slots in as one of the system's higher-upside developmental pieces. A consensus top-75 prospect at just 19 years old, Morales is years from contributing at the major league level — but in a forever-keeper dynasty format, the long runway is the point. <strong>Felnin Celesten</strong> (20), the 2025 first-round pick, is the system's most contested name: one major scouting service ranks him inside the top 50, another places him outside the top 100. That kind of divergence usually signals either a sleeper who hasn't fully registered on the consensus radar or a prospect whose floor is shakier than the top ranking implies. At 20, he has time to resolve the question either way.</p>

  <p><strong>Ralphy Velazquez</strong> (20) presents a similar scouting split — top 60 by one service, outside the top 150 by another. The consensus lands around 110, which makes him a mid-system piece with meaningful projection. <strong>Eduardo Tait</strong> (19) is the deepest developmental stash in the group, ranking around 148 by consensus.

  <ul style="margin: 0 0 1.2em 1.5em; color: #222; line-height: 1.9;">
    <li><em>Pre-Auction (by March 15):</em> <strong>Jackson Jobe</strong> — MLB-ready, a legitimate candidate to be activated to the active roster before the auction deadline. The $0 cost makes this one of the most compelling call-up decisions in the league.</li>
    <li><em>Early-to-Mid Season (April–June):</em> None projected from the current group.</li>
    <li><em>Mid-to-Late Season:</em> <strong>Emmanuel Rodriguez</strong>, if development accelerates.</li>

  <h2>On the Bubble: Pre-Auction Speculation</h2>

  <p>DiMauro cannot enter the auction room with a $322 roster salary and hope the magic continues. He needs to cut. The question is who, and how much. Several players on the active roster are live candidates between now and March 22 — some nearly certain to go, others requiring a harder judgment call.</p>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Joe Musgrove — $5, Year 3:</strong> The easiest call on the roster. Musgrove posted zero fantasy points in 2025 — no games played, no contribution, nothing. He was acquired via trade from Seattle in April 2025 at $1 in Year 1, presumably as a depth piece with some upside. Whatever plan existed for him in 2025 evaporated entirely. At $5 for Year 3, the cost is low enough that the emotional pull might be to hold him as a speculative flier. That would be a mistake. A $5 keeper slot on a team with a negative auction budget needs to produce real value or get cut. Musgrove provides no evidence he can.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Logan Gilbert — $26, Year 6:</strong> This is the biggest drop candidate on the roster and the most uncomfortable one to discuss. Gilbert pitched well when available — 12.9 FPts/G is legitimate mid-rotation production — but he managed only 25 starts in 2025, totaling 323.5 FPts against a $26 keeper cost. At Year 6, his salary escalates another $5 per season indefinitely. A pitcher who can give you 25-28 reliable starts is worth $26. A pitcher who gives you 20-22 starts is not, especially when you have Jackson Jobe available at $0 and need every dollar you can recover. If DiMauro is going to generate meaningful auction budget, cutting Gilbert is the move that unlocks the most flexibility — $26 recovered, a rotation spot opened for Jobe, and the only cost is the emotional weight of releasing a known quantity. The spreadsheet makes this decision easy. The owner has to make it anyway.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Shane Bieber — $10, Year 3:</strong> The hardest call on the list. When Bieber pitches, he is elite — 15.5 FPts per start in 2025 puts him in ace territory per outing. The problem is he made exactly seven starts last season. Seven. At $10 for Year 3, you're betting that a pitcher with serious recent injury history can give you 20-plus starts in 2026. If he does, the value is there. If he gives you ten starts — or four, or none — you've burned a roster slot and ten dollars on a hope. Given the salary pressure LVA is under, $10 spent on an injury-prone arm could be $10 that goes toward a healthy, productive free agent. This is a genuine coin flip, and reasonable people can argue both sides.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Ivan Herrera — $10, Year 4:</strong> Herrera's profile is solid but narrow. He posted 330 FPts in 107 games (3.1 FPts/G, adequate) and is eligible at Utility only — no primary position to anchor a lineup slot, no strong dynasty case as a long-term hold. At $10 on a team that desperately needs auction flexibility, he's the kind of player who makes perfect sense on a team with budget to spare and becomes a quiet casualty on a team that doesn't. If DiMauro is cutting for dollars, Herrera is on the list alongside Gilbert and Musgrove.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Auction Strategy</span>
  <h2>Free Agent Auction Strategy</h2>

  <p>Here is the fundamental math problem Mike DiMauro must solve before March 22: the 2026 keeper salary, after escalation, comes to approximately $317 (with Roupp already released). The auction cap is $260. That leaves a deficit of $57 before he spends a single dollar on a free agent. Every bid DiMauro makes at the auction table must first be funded by cuts from the existing roster. There is no meaningful auction participation without meaningful preemptive releases.</p>

  <p>The competitive context makes this worse. The 2026 budget comparison is a map of who dominates the auction and who watches. Philadelphia ($199 available), Toronto ($185), Chicago Cubs ($167), Atlanta ($135), Washington ($129), and Cincinnati ($124) will all enter the room with the firepower to outbid anyone for any player they want. LVA, as currently constructed, has nothing. They are the richest team on the active roster and the most constrained at the auction table — a paradox of dynasty roster construction that DiMauro has to navigate carefully.</p>

  <p>The most logical path to generating meaningful budget: cut <strong>Joe Musgrove</strong> ($5), <strong>Logan Gilbert</strong> ($26), <strong>Shane Bieber</strong> ($10), and <strong>Ivan Herrera</strong> ($10). That's $51 in recovered salary, bringing the 2026 total to roughly $266 and the auction budget to roughly negative-$6. Still over. Add <strong>Kenley Jansen</strong> ($10) and the budget reaches positive $4 — not enough to compete for stars, but enough to exist in the room. Add a genuine surprise cut — <strong>Manny Machado</strong> ($38) being the most impactful option — and suddenly $42 in real auction dollars appears, along with a question about whether the team is better or worse for his absence.</p>

  <p>Assuming DiMauro threads the needle and generates $30-50 in auction budget through strategic cuts, here is how that money should be deployed:</p>

  <p><strong>Priority 1 — Juan Soto:</strong> He just left the building. DiMauro knows exactly what Soto produces — 661.5 FPts, every game, at the highest level of reliability. The market for Soto will be ferocious. Philadelphia, Toronto, the Cubs, Atlanta — every team with budget will want him, and the winning bid will likely land between $85-105. Unless DiMauro makes wholesale cuts to enter that range, Soto probably goes to someone else. Watching him walk out the door twice in two years would be a particularly specific kind of heartbreak, but DiMauro could look to strike a deal with one of those clubs prior to the auction for a draft-and-trade scenario to get Soto back in the fold for another championship run. It will take creativity, but it could happen.</p>

  <p><strong>Priority 2 — Rafael Devers:</strong> Devers passed through LVA's own roster during the May trade sequence before landing in Cincinnati as the currency for Soto. He posted 522 FPts and is one of the better third basemen available, especially relevant if DiMauro ultimately decides Machado's $38 price tag is too high. A realistic bid of $35-45 for Devers represents genuine roster impact — a known commodity at a position of potential need, acquired at a price that doesn't require liquidating the entire roster to fund it.</p>

  <p><strong>Priority 3 — Gleyber Torres:</strong> With Lindor and Henderson already occupying the infield, Torres isn't a necessity — but his 404.5 FPts and 2B/SS eligibility make him a useful piece of depth that likely clears the auction at $12-18. If DiMauro has budget left after competing for the top targets, a Torres bid makes sense as roster insurance.</p>

  <p><strong>Secondary Targets from the "Likely Cut" Pool:</strong> Given their salary constraints, the A's likely won't be in the market for any players that are cut prior to the roster cut deadline; however, releasing one or both of Machado and Gilbert could change this narrative.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Draft</span>
  <h2>MiLB Draft Outlook</h2>

  <p>The MiLB slow draft runs March 15-22, and LVA arrives with pick #16 — a late position in the first round, the natural consequence of having one of the league's best regular-season records. The elite prospects at every position will likely be gone by the time the Athletics pick, which means DiMauro's draft strategy is less about identifying the obvious stars and more about identifying the players who fell further than their talent warranted.</p>

  <p>Three MiLB slots are available to fill. The existing system — Clark, Jobe, Rodriguez, Morales, Celesten, Velazquez, Tait — is already among the deepest in the league, so these picks are about adding depth and diversification rather than rescuing a depleted farm. The system currently skews toward pitching and outfield. A premium on offensive prospects at premium positions — catcher, shortstop, third base — would give the organization balance and provide a development track for positions that may become needs as the active roster ages.</p>

  <p>One decision looms larger than the draft itself: the Jackson Jobe call-up. MiLB roster locks happen March 15, before the draft concludes. If Jobe is activated to the active MLB roster before that deadline, a MiLB slot opens up, giving LVA an additional pick position to deploy. If Jobe stays in the minor league system, the Athletics draft with their three slots as currently configured. Given that Jobe is major-league ready and available at $0 cost to the active roster, the calculus strongly favors activating him and using the freed slot to draft another upside prospect. It's essentially getting a free rotation arm while also getting an extra draft pick. The only reason not to do it is if DiMauro wants another year of service-time optionality on Jobe — a legitimate concern in real baseball that carries less weight in a dynasty context where production is the only currency that matters.</p>

  <p>Draft strategy recommendation: target one advanced college arm with late-breaking stuff, one projectable middle-infield bat with defensive value, and treat the third slot as a pure upside swing — the player ranked 20th who might be the best in the class by 2028. At pick #16, you can't predict who falls. You can decide in advance how you'll respond when someone does.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Prediction</span>
  <h2>2026 Season Prediction</h2>

  <div class="prediction-box">
    <p><strong>Projected Record:</strong> 13–6 to 15–4 (depending on auction and cut decisions)</p>
    <p><strong>Projected Seed:</strong> Top 3</p>
    <p><strong>Ceiling:</strong> TSDL Champions. The core — Judge, Lindor, Carroll, Henderson, Rodon, deGrom — is championship-caliber regardless of what happens at the auction table. If Jackson Jobe graduates to the active roster and provides ace-level production at $0, the entire salary equation shifts in LVA's favor. Add one meaningful free agent acquisition through strategic pre-auction cuts and this team is as dangerous as anyone in the league.</p>
    <p><strong>Floor:</strong> Conference finals exit, again — a 12-13 win regular season followed by one bad two-week stretch that ends the run. The talent is real. The depth behind the top eight players is thinner than it's been in two seasons. If Judge or deGrom miss significant time, the margin for error is slim.</p>
    <p><strong>Bold Call:</strong> DiMauro cuts Logan Gilbert before the auction — freeing $26, promoting Jackson Jobe at $0, and effectively replacing one inconsistent $26 starter with one elite $0 starter. The move generates just enough budget to make a meaningful bid on one top-tier free agent. It doesn't fully solve the auction problem, but it solves the rotation problem while partially solving the budget problem. That's the kind of precise, unsentimental move that defines how DiMauro operates.</p>
    <p>Two seasons in, 30 wins and counting, a championship ring and a conference finals exit. The Las Vegas Athletics are the league's most consistently excellent franchise, and they are also the franchise most urgently in need of a structural reset before the salary clock runs out. DiMauro has proven he knows how to build. The next test is whether he knows how to adapt. Everything suggests he does.</p>
