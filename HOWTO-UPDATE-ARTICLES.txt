PUBLISHING A NEW SEASON PREVIEW ARTICLE
-----------------------------------------

Step 1 — Generate the article using TSDL2026 pipeline
  Run notebook 44 in TSDL2026/notebooks/04_article_generation/
  Output: TSDL2026/articles/YYYY-MM-DD/season_preview_2026_[TEAM].html
          TSDL2026/articles/YYYY-MM-DD/charts/*.png

Step 2 — Copy the article file to sandlottribune
  Copy:  TSDL2026/articles/YYYY-MM-DD/season_preview_2026_[TEAM].html
  To:    sandlottribune/season-previews/season_preview_2026_[TEAM].html

  Copy the charts folder contents:
  From:  TSDL2026/articles/YYYY-MM-DD/charts/*.png
  To:    sandlottribune/season-previews/charts/*.png
  NOTE: The article HTML references charts as "charts/filename.png" — keep
        them in the season-previews/charts/ folder so links work correctly.

Step 3 — Prepare a thumbnail image
  Crop the team's preview image (removing watermark) and save as:
    sandlottribune/assets/images/[team]-preview.png
  Team codes: ari, atl, bos, chc, cin, col, hou, las, mia, mil,
              nyy, phi, san, sea, stl, tex, tor, wsh
  Example: Arizona = ari-preview.png

Step 4 — Update season-previews/index.html
  Open: sandlottribune/season-previews/index.html
  Find the comment that says "More previews will be added here"
  Paste this template ABOVE that comment block (newest article at top):

  ---- COPY FROM HERE ----
        <li>
          <article class="article-list-card">
            <img class="card-image" src="../assets/images/[TEAM]-preview.png" alt="[Team Name] 2026 Season Preview">
            <div class="card-body">
              <span class="card-badge">Season Preview</span>
              <h2 class="card-title">2026 TSDL Season Preview: [Team Name]</h2>
              <p class="card-meta">By [Author Name] &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; [Month Day, Year]</p>
              <p class="card-excerpt">[1-2 sentence teaser about the team and article.]</p>
              <a class="card-link" href="season_preview_2026_[TEAM].html">Read Article &rarr;</a>
            </div>
          </article>
        </li>
  ---- COPY TO HERE ----

  Replace [TEAM], [Team Name], [Author Name], [Month Day, Year], and the teaser.

Step 5 — Update the home page (index.html) "Latest News" section
  Open: sandlottribune/index.html
  The "Latest News" section shows the 3-4 most recent articles.
  The home page currently has 1 real article card + 2 placeholder cards.

  ADDING A SECOND REAL ARTICLE:
  - Find the two placeholder <div class="article-card article-card--placeholder">
  - Replace the FIRST placeholder with a real article card (template below)
  - Keep the second placeholder until you have a 3rd article

  ADDING A 3RD OR 4TH ARTICLE:
  - Replace the remaining placeholder with a real article card
  - Once all 3 slots have real articles, add a 4th using the same template

  WHEN YOU HAVE MORE THAN 4 ARTICLES:
  - Remove the oldest article card from index.html (it stays in season-previews/)
  - The home page only shows the 4 most recent across all sections

  HOME PAGE ARTICLE CARD TEMPLATE (for a season preview):
  ---- COPY FROM HERE ----
        <!-- [Team Name] Season Preview -->
        <article class="article-card">
          <img class="card-image" src="assets/images/[TEAM]-preview.png" alt="[Team Name] 2026 Season Preview">
          <div class="card-body">
            <span class="card-badge">Season Preview</span>
            <h3 class="card-title">2026 TSDL Season Preview: [Team Name]</h3>
            <p class="card-meta">By [Author Name] &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; [Month Day, Year]</p>
            <p class="card-excerpt">[1-2 sentence teaser.]</p>
            <a class="card-link" href="season-previews/season_preview_2026_[TEAM].html">Read Article &rarr;</a>
          </div>
        </article>
  ---- COPY TO HERE ----

  NOTE: The original featured ARI article uses class="article-card article-card--featured"
  with a 2-column layout. Future non-featured cards use just class="article-card".
  You can keep ARI as the featured card or swap it for the newest article
  by changing its class back to "article-card" and making the new one "featured".

Step 6 — Push to GitHub
  In Git Bash or your terminal:
    cd C:/Users/RTSch/sandlottribune
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add 2026 season preview: [Team Name]"
    git push origin main
  The site updates automatically within 1-2 minutes.

PUBLISHING POWER RANKINGS / MATCHUP ARTICLES / TRADE ANALYSIS
---------------------------------------------------------------

These sections are currently "Coming Soon" under Between The Chalk.
When ready to activate:

Step 1 — Create the article folder and hub
  mkdir sandlottribune/power-rankings/
  Create sandlottribune/power-rankings/index.html (copy season-previews/index.html as a template, update section name and article list)

Step 2 — Update the "Explore" grid on index.html
  Find the "Power Rankings" explore card with class="explore-card" (cursor:default)
  Replace the entire <div> block with:
    <a class="explore-card" href="power-rankings/index.html">
      <span class="explore-card-title">Power Rankings</span>
    </a>

Step 3 — Update between-the-chalk/index.html
  Replace the under-construction content with real article cards
  (same pattern as season-previews/index.html)

ADDING A NEW TOP-LEVEL SECTION (when a Coming Soon page goes live)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Replace the under-construction content in that section's index.html
   with real content (article list or formatted page)
2. In index.html (home), make sure the nav link is correct (it already is)
3. Optionally add the section to the "Explore" grid on the home page
4. Push to GitHub

PUSHING CHANGES TO GITHUB PAGES
----------------------------------

  cd C:/Users/RTSch/sandlottribune

  git add .               ← stage all changes
  git commit -m "Brief description of what you changed"
  git push origin main

The site at your GitHub Pages URL updates within 1-2 minutes of pushing.
