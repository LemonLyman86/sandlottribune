  <span class="section-kicker">Dynasty Royalty</span>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Las Vegas Athletics arrived in The Sandlot Dynasty League two years ago and promptly decided to skip the learning curve entirely. In 2024, <strong>Mike DiMauro</strong> won the championship. In 2025, he went 15-4 in the regular season, earned the #2 seed, and bowed out in the conference semifinals to an Arizona Diamondbacks squad that would go on to claim the title as an 8th seed. Two seasons of TSDL existence. Thirty wins. Eight losses. One ring. The only losing streak of any consequence was when the schedule was mildly unkind.</p>

  <div class="quick-stats">
    <div class="stat-item"><span class="stat-label">2025 Record</span><span class="stat-value">15-4</span></div>
    <div class="stat-item"><span class="stat-label">Total FPts</span><span class="stat-value">6,334</span></div>

    <div class="stat-item"><span class="stat-label">2026 Auction $</span><span class="stat-value">$11</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The catch — and there is always a catch — is the bill. Carrying $249 in keeper salary into 2026 leaves Las Vegas with exactly $11 for the free agent auction. Eleven dollars. For context: <strong>Philadelphia</strong> walks in with $199. <strong>Toronto</strong> has $185. <strong>Chicago</strong> has $167. The defending 2024 champion is showing up to the buffet with what amounts to seat cushion change while everyone else ordered the wagyu.</p>

  <p>This is not a rebuilding story, and it is not a warning sign. It is the structural consequence of building an exceptional roster and having the conviction to keep it intact. The core of Las Vegas is still, by any honest measure, among the three best rosters in this league. <strong>Aaron Judge</strong>, <strong>Corbin Carroll</strong>, <strong>Gunnar Henderson</strong>, <strong>Francisco Lindor</strong>, <strong>Carlos Rodon</strong>, <strong>Jacob deGrom</strong> — these are not depth pieces. These are franchise cornerstones, and most of them are signed to contracts that still represent reasonable value for 2026.</p>

  <p>But the farm system is now the team's primary reinforcement mechanism, the trade market is their only meaningful acquisition channel, and the FA auction is essentially a spectator sport for them this spring. DiMauro has proven he can navigate every one of those constraints with creativity and conviction. The question for 2026 is whether the roster can absorb the absence of <strong>Juan Soto</strong> — the second-best fantasy player in the league last season, now a free agent — and whether the pitching staff can stay healthy enough to carry what was already a hitting-dominant team into another championship run.</p>


  <span class="section-kicker">2025 Offseason</span>
  <h2>2025 In-Season Moves</h2>

  <p><strong>MiLB Draft:</strong> LVA entered the 2025 slow draft with pick 17 in every round — the price of finishing among the league's elite the prior year. They made five new selections: <strong>Felnin Celesten</strong> in Round 1, <strong>Jaison Chourio</strong> in Round 2, <strong>George Klassen</strong> in Round 3, <strong>Ralphy Velazquez</strong> in Round 4, and <strong>Emil Morales</strong> in Round 5. Five additional players — <strong>Heston Kjerstad</strong>, <strong>Emmanuel Rodriguez</strong>, <strong>Max Clark</strong>, <strong>Thomas White</strong>, and <strong>Jackson Jobe</strong> — were retained from the previous year without consuming draft picks.</p>

  <p>The draft class, in hindsight, was less about building the farm and more about creating trade inventory. Chourio and Klassen were both dealt away in May. Kjerstad was also moved. White went to Philadelphia in August. The five "new picks" ultimately became three keepers (Celesten, Velazquez, Morales) and two chips — which, given the quality of what those chips brought back, was the correct calculus.</p>

  <p><strong>FA Auction:</strong> With a meaningful portion of his 2025 keeper salary locked in before the auction, DiMauro spent $70 — a controlled approach that read less like budget caution and more like roster confidence. When you already have Judge and Lindor and Carroll locked in, you don't need to chase stars. The centerpiece of the auction was <strong>Manny Machado</strong> at $34/Yr1, a bet that paid off immediately: Machado finished with 486.5 FPts across 159 games. <strong>Marcus Semien</strong> went for $23 and was later flipped in a trade for <strong>Reese Olson</strong>. <strong>Shane Bieber</strong> cost $6 and delivered only 7 starts before injury cut his season short — the one genuine swing-and-miss in an otherwise shrewd spring.</p>

  <p><strong>In-Season Trades:</strong> Mike DiMauro made ten trades in 2025. Ten. In a nineteen-week regular season. The man operates like he has a direct line to every other owner's uncertainty.</p>

  <p>The most audacious sequence of moves in the league last year unfolded over a span of eleven days in May. On May 9, DiMauro received <strong>Carlos Rodon</strong> and <strong>Rafael Devers</strong> from Boston, giving up Klassen, <strong>Luis Garcia</strong>, <strong>Riley Greene</strong> (acquired just weeks earlier from Chicago), and Wesneski. Eight days later, he sent Devers — a player he had owned for less than two weeks — to Cincinnati in exchange for <strong>Juan Soto</strong> and Luis Gil. Two days after that, he flipped Luis Gil to Boston for <strong>Logan Gilbert</strong> and a prospect. Devers and Gil were each held for less than a week and used as currencies across three separate transactions without either appearing in a single LVA lineup. The result: Rodon, Soto, and Gilbert — a rotation ace, the league's second-best hitter, and a dependable starter — all acquired in an eleven-day sprint.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">DiMauro used Juan Soto as a $90 seasonal rental, squeezed 661.5 FPts out of him, then released him into the free agent pool rather than commit to $95/Yr4. That is cold. That is also excellent dynasty management.</blockquote>

  <p>The August 1 deadline was equally aggressive. DiMauro extracted <strong>Jacob deGrom</strong> from Cincinnati — at $28/Yr2 for <strong>Lawrence Butler</strong> — which may be the single best individual trade of the 2025 season. Simultaneously, he pulled a three-piece return from Philadelphia: <strong>Ivan Herrera</strong>, <strong>Bryan Reynolds</strong>, and Emil Morales (the same Emil Morales he had traded to Philadelphia pre-season for Eduardo Tait, now coming back as part of a larger deal). Reynolds and Olson would ultimately be cut in the offseason, but Herrera, deGrom, and Morales all survived into 2026.</p>

  <p>The one critique of the trading strategy: some of the assets acquired mid-season (Reynolds, Helsley, Olson) didn't justify their contracts long-term, requiring further offseason trimming. But that's a minor efficiency argument against a portfolio of moves that net-added deGrom, Rodon, Gilbert, Herrera, and Morales. Overall grade: <span class="grade">A</span></p>


  <span class="section-kicker">Season Recap</span>
  <h2>2025 Season in Review</h2>

  <p>The 2025 Las Vegas Athletics were elite from the start — well, after Week 1. They dropped their opener to Seattle by 63.5 points (395-458.5), then won 14 of their next 15 to make the league forget that loss ever happened. By Week 5 they sat at #1 in the power rankings, and they never fell below 5th for the remainder of the regular season. Four losses in nineteen weeks. That's the ledger of a team with a structural advantage over most of its competition.</p>

  <p>The hits were predictable and relentless. <strong>Aaron Judge</strong> led the league at his position with 693 FPts in 152 games (4.6 per game). <strong>Juan Soto</strong> added 661.5 in 160 games. <strong>Francisco Lindor</strong> delivered 574.5 FPts. <strong>Corbin Carroll</strong> chipped in 551.5 across 143 games. <strong>Carlos Rodon</strong>, in 33 starts after arriving via trade in May, posted 541.5 FPts at a per-game rate (16.4) that ranked among the best in the league. Six players cleared 450 FPts. The team's hitting total of 4,800 FPts sat 34% above the league average of 3,584.5 — a gap that no other roster could come close to matching.</p>

  <div class="stat-grid">
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Hitting FPts</strong><br>4,800.0 — 56.3% of total<br>League Avg: 3,584.5</div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Pitching FPts</strong><br>3,726.5 — 43.7% of total<br>League Avg: 3,098.9</div>
  </div>

    <figcaption>2025 Hitting vs. Pitching Split — All Teams</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The pitching side — 3,726.5 FPts against a league average of 3,098.9 — was solidly above average but not the team's calling card. This was, and will likely remain, a hitting-dominant team. The 56/44 split in favor of bats tells the real story of how Las Vegas wins.</p>

  <p>There were rough patches. Week 11 produced the team's worst single-week output (207 FPts, a 143.5-point loss to St. Louis). Week 12 brought the most painful result of the season: a 1-point loss to Atlanta (267-268), the narrowest margin of defeat all year. The Week 8 loss to San Diego and the Week 1 opener rounded out the four regular-season blemishes.</p>

  <p>In the playoffs, LVA handled Toronto in the divisional round convincingly (725.5-614.5, 111-point margin). The conference round brought Arizona, and while Las Vegas put up 728 points — a legitimate elite total — Arizona answered with 762. A 34-point margin ended the season. The eventual champion took out the defending champion. There is no shame in that.</p>

  <p>The third-place game against Seattle was an emphatic 739.5-484 win, a 255.5-point rout that served as both a statement and a palate cleanser after the conference loss. It secured a #16 draft position — a high pick for a team this accomplished — and let the Athletics finish the year on their terms.</p>

  <p>Best FAAB moment of the season: <strong>Kenley Jansen</strong>, claimed off waivers on September 9. He's still on the roster entering 2026 at $7/Yr2, which means DiMauro caught a closer in peak form late in the year and locked him in for another season at a price that makes most closers in this league look overpriced by comparison.</p>


  <span class="section-kicker">Offseason Moves</span>
  <h2>Offseason Roster Cuts</h2>

  <p>Nine players departed the Las Vegas roster this winter. They range from obvious salary escapes to decisions that required genuine conviction.</p>

  <p>The headline is <strong>Juan Soto</strong>. He produced 661.5 FPts in 160 games — second-best performance in the entire league, behind only Shohei Ohtani — and DiMauro released him anyway. This is not negligence. This is $90 at Year 3 becoming $95 at Year 4, a contract that would consume more than a third of the entire auction cap and continue escalating in perpetuity. Keeping Soto would have meant gutting the roster around him to stay under reasonable budget constraints. Instead, DiMauro let him walk into free agency, where he will almost certainly command a $60-80 auction bid from one of the teams with real spending power. The move was correct. It still stings.</p>

  <p><strong>Raisel Iglesias</strong> ($19/Yr4 → $24/Yr5): 353.5 FPts and 70 appearances, but closer value is the most volatile commodity in fantasy baseball, and $24 at Year 5 is the kind of contract structure that almost never pays off on a relief pitcher. Right call.</p>

  <p><strong>Bryan Reynolds</strong> ($26/Yr4 → $31/Yr5): Solid producer (358.5 FPts) but an outfielder entering Year 4 with a climbing salary and no room on a roster already stacked in the outfield. The math stopped working.</p>

  <p><strong>Gleyber Torres</strong> ($6/Yr2 → $9/Yr3): This one is the most debatable cut in the group. Torres posted 404.5 FPts with 2B/SS eligibility, and $9 at Year 3 is still reasonable value. The likely logic: LVA already has Lindor and Henderson at SS, and the roster spot had more value elsewhere. I'd have kept him, but I understand the decision.</p>

  <p>The remaining cuts — <strong>Bailey Ober</strong> ($7→$12, 242 FPts), <strong>Reese Olson</strong> ($6→$11, only 143.5 FPts), <strong>Royce Lewis</strong> ($5→$10, 241 FPts), <strong>Clayton Kershaw</strong> ($1→$2, career winds down), and <strong>Shawn Armstrong</strong> ($1→$2, replacement-level reliever) — range from obvious to pragmatic. Ober and Olson underperformed their salary escalation paths. Lewis never could stay healthy. Kershaw and Armstrong were cut with zero sentimental attachment, which is the only appropriate way to handle $1 Year 1 veterans.</p>

  </figure>


  <span class="section-kicker">The Roster</span>
  <h2>The Core — Returning Players</h2>

  <p>Seventeen players remain, carrying $249 in combined keeper salary — sixth-highest in the league. The salary map above tells the architectural story at a glance: seven players are entering Year 5 contracts, meaning their salaries escalate by another $5 each offseason from here. This is a roster at or near peak expense for most of its key components, which is why the next two years represent LVA's maximum championship window before the math forces some difficult decisions.</p>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Aaron Judge</div>
    <div class="player-meta">OF | 2026 Salary: $39 | Contract Year: 5</div>
    <p>The foundation. Judge's 693 FPts in 152 games (4.6 per game) led all offensive players in the league — nobody else cracked 700 FPts from a position player, and only Soto came close. At $39 entering Year 5, the next escalation puts him at $44 in 2027, then $49, then $54. The arithmetic will eventually become uncomfortable, but that is a 2028 problem. In 2026, Judge is the unquestioned anchor of this lineup and one of the three best fantasy players available in any format.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Corbin Carroll</div>
    <div class="player-meta">OF | 2026 Salary: $10 | Contract Year: 4</div>
    <p>The most unambiguous value on this roster. Carroll's 551.5 FPts across 143 games (3.86 per game) at a cost of $10 is the kind of efficiency that makes opposing owners quietly furious when they look at their own outfield salaries. He enters Year 4 at $10, heading to $15/Yr5 and $20/Yr6 — both still deeply below market value for a player at his level. Carroll's combination of power and speed gives LVA a production profile that most teams need two players to replicate. DiMauro should hold this contract until the contract year forces his hand, which won't be for a long time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Gunnar Henderson</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SS | 2026 Salary: $6 | Contract Year: 3</div>
    <p>The sleeper that becomes the cornerstone. Henderson's 461.5 FPts in 154 games at $6 is staggering efficiency from a 25-year-old SS-eligible player entering what should be his statistical peak. At $6/Yr3, his next escalation puts him at $11/Yr4, then $16, $21 — all still reasonable for a player of his caliber. The case can be made that Henderson is actually the most important asset on this roster for the next three-to-five years, precisely because his salary curve hasn't started climbing in earnest yet. Judge may be the franchise face, but Henderson is the dynasty engine.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Carlos Rodon</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP | 2026 Salary: $21 | Contract Year: 5</div>
    <p>The ace. In 33 starts after arriving via trade, Rodon posted 541.5 FPts at 16.41 per start — one of the best per-game rates among starting pitchers in the league. At $21, he's producing like a pitcher worth $35. The durability concern is real (Rodon's health history is well-documented in real baseball), but 33 starts suggests he found his rhythm. Year 5 at $21 escalates to $26, which still represents strong value if he stays healthy. He is, when right, a legitimate ace, and LVA's rotation doesn't function at the same level without him.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Beyond the four pillars: <strong>Francisco Lindor</strong> (SS, $34/Yr5) delivered 574.5 FPts in 160 games — elite floor, 3.59 per game, the definition of a set-it-and-forget-it SS in fantasy. He's expensive but still producing at the rate that justifies $34. <strong>Manny Machado</strong> (3B, $35/Yr2) put up 486.5 FPts in 159 games, and critically, he's only at Year 2 — meaning there's production upside still ahead before the salary escalation becomes burdensome. <strong>Jacob deGrom</strong> (SP, $31/Yr3) is the controlled risk of the rotation: 477.5 FPts in 30 starts (15.9 per start), absolutely elite when healthy, and carrying the perpetual injury asterisk that has defined his career since 2021. DiMauro got him for a song from Cincinnati in August; the 2026 bet is whether he stays on the field.</p>

  <p><strong>Tyler Soderstrom</strong> (1B/OF, $5/Yr3) posted 437.5 FPts in 158 games at $5 — outstanding value across dual-eligible positions. <strong>Joe Ryan</strong> (SP, $16/Yr5) is the rotation's reliable workhorse: 439 FPts in 31 starts (14.2 per start), consistent and safe. <strong>George Kirby</strong> (SP, $6/Yr3) made only 23 starts but posted 296.5 FPts at an elite per-start rate — if healthy for a full season in 2026, Kirby at $6 is one of the better-concealed rotation values in the entire league. <strong>Kenley Jansen</strong> (RP, $7/Yr2) rounds out the bullpen as a proven closer. <strong>Logan Gilbert</strong> (SP, $21/Yr5) managed 25 starts and 323.5 FPts — serviceable numbers at a salary entering expensive territory, with $26/Yr6 on the horizon.</p>

  <p><strong>Landen Roupp</strong> (SP, $2/Yr2): 203 FPts in just 22 starts, which translates to 9.2 per game — excellent per-start efficiency for a pitcher who cost $2. He's the depth piece with the most upside for 2026. <strong>Daylen Lile</strong> (OF, $2/Yr2) contributed 259 FPts in 91 games as a waiver find who stuck. <strong>Ivan Herrera</strong> (UT, $5/Yr3) posted 330 FPts as a utility player — fine production at a fine price, though his eligibility limited only to the utility slot constrains his versatility.</p>

  <p><strong>Shane Bieber</strong> (SP, $7/Yr2) and <strong>Joe Musgrove</strong> (SP, $2/Yr2) are the two significant question marks. Bieber made 7 starts (108.5 FPts) before injury ended his year. Musgrove posted zero fantasy points — he did not appear in a meaningful game in 2025. Both remain on the active roster entering the spring, which leads us directly to Drop Watch.</p>

  <p>Total 2026 FA auction budget with all keepers intact: <strong>$11</strong>.</p>


  <span class="section-kicker">The Minors</span>
  <h2>Farm Report</h2>

  <p>With $11 in auction budget, the farm system is not a supplemental asset — it is the primary mechanism through which Las Vegas rebuilds its roster. The good news is that LVA currently holds one of the three best farm systems in this league, and it isn't a close call at the top.</p>

  <p><strong>Max Clark</strong> (OF, 21, Detroit Tigers) is the crown jewel. A consensus top-10 prospect in professional baseball — both major scouting services place him in the elite tier of the entire draft-eligible and pre-MLB population — Clark is a premium offensive outfielder with a hit tool, speed, and contact quality that projects as a legitimate five-category contributor. He's 21 years old and his MLB debut is not a matter of if, but when. When Detroit calls him up and LVA moves him to the active roster, the team gains a productive starting outfielder at $0 cost. Max Clark alone makes this farm system elite. He's the kind of prospect that would command the first overall selection in the MiLB slow draft from any other team in this league.</p>

  <p><strong>Jackson Jobe</strong> (SP, 23, Detroit Tigers) has already crossed the prospect threshold — he appeared in 10 MLB games in 2025 and posted 97.5 FPts. He doesn't appear on the major scouting services' prospect lists at this point, which typically means he's accrued enough service time to graduate. The important question for LVA is whether to promote him to the active roster before the March 15 auction deadline — which would open a MiLB slot for a new draft pick. Given that Jobe has demonstrated real major league viability, the answer should be yes, especially if Bieber and Musgrove are released to create rotation vacancies.</p>

  <p><strong>Emmanuel Rodriguez</strong> (OF, 22, Minnesota Twins) checks in as a consensus top-55 prospect — a legitimate top-of-the-lineup outfield profile with plus speed and a developing hit tool. At 22, he's a genuine candidate for a midseason MLB callup in 2026, and his eventual arrival could partially offset the organizational cost of losing Soto.</p>

  <p><strong>Emil Morales</strong> (19) is the prospect DiMauro traded away and then recovered. Originally drafted in the 2025 MiLB draft at Round 5, Morales was included in the pre-season deal with Philadelphia for Eduardo Tait, then returned in the August deadline trade. The fact that DiMauro re-acquired him when he could have taken a different asset says something about how the organization values his upside. He ranks as a consensus top-75 prospect.</p>

  <p><strong>Felnin Celesten</strong> (20) is the system's most contested name. The two major scouting services have him 70 spots apart — one has him inside the top 50, the other outside the top 100. That level of evaluative divergence usually signals a high-variance prospect with premium raw tools but significant developmental risk. At 20 with time on his side, the consensus ranking lands around #82. Check back in two years.</p>

  <p><strong>Ralphy Velazquez</strong> (20) also carries divergent rankings (one source near 60, another near 160), settling at a consensus around #112. A mid-round pick with upside still to be determined. <strong>Eduardo Tait</strong> (19) is the system's longest-term stash — the original return from that pre-season Morales deal, now ranking around #144 in the consensus, a teenager with a multi-year runway before contributing.</p>

  <p><strong>Potential 2026 Call-Up Timeline:</strong></p>
  <ul style="margin: 0 0 1.2em 1.6em; color: #222;">
    <li><strong>Before Auction (3/15):</strong> Jackson Jobe — promote to the active roster now, open a MiLB slot</li>
    <li><strong>Early Season (April–May):</strong> Max Clark — Detroit's timeline likely targets a mid-spring debut</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-Season:</strong> Emmanuel Rodriguez — could emerge as a second-half callup if Minnesota needs outfield help</li>
    <li><strong>Long-Term Stashes:</strong> Emil Morales, Felnin Celesten, Ralphy Velazquez, Eduardo Tait (all 2027–2028 ETA)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Farm System Grade: <span class="grade">A&minus;</span> — The minus exists only because Max Clark's imminent graduation means the elite top of this system is about to leave. The next tier (Rodriguez, Morales, Celesten) is legitimately strong but one level below transcendent. Still, this is one of the better farm setups attached to an active championship-caliber roster in TSDL.</p>


  <span class="section-kicker">Bubble Watch</span>
  <h2>Drop Watch — Pre-Auction Speculation</h2>

  <p>Three players on the current active roster have real cases for release before the March 22 auction. DiMauro should think carefully about all three — not because they lack value in theory, but because the financial math of keeping them could be more damaging than the production math of losing them.</p>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Joe Musgrove — SP, $2/Yr2</strong><br>The easiest decision on this roster. Musgrove posted zero fantasy points in 2025 — no games, no starts, no contribution whatsoever. He was injured before the season and never returned. At $2, the salary is trivial, but the roster spot is not when you have an active MiLB system and potential SP vacancies from the Bieber situation. Release him, reclaim the spot, open the budget to $13. There is no argument for keeping Musgrove on this roster heading into spring.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Shane Bieber — SP, $7/Yr2</strong><br>The harder call, but still leans toward release. Bieber made 7 starts in 2025 before injury shut him down, and his per-start efficiency in those limited appearances (15.5 FPts per game) was genuinely excellent — when healthy, he's a rotation asset. The problem is "when healthy" is carrying all the weight in that sentence. Whatever took him down in 2025 remains an open question entering spring training, and $7 heading to $10/Yr3 is non-trivial when the team has $11 total auction budget. If DiMauro has credible intelligence that Bieber is fully healthy and ready for a full workload, keep him. If there's any uncertainty about the return timeline, the $7 does more good as auction budget.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Logan Gilbert — SP, $21/Yr5</strong><br>This is the drop DiMauro should think hardest about, and I'd argue it's the right move. Gilbert made 25 starts in 2025 (323.5 FPts, 12.9 per start) — solid but not spectacular numbers for a pitcher at $21 heading to $26/Yr6. He's producing like a reliable mid-rotation arm but costing like a frontline starter. In a league where pitching talent is available in the auction every spring, paying $21 for average-to-slightly-above production while holding only $11 in budget is a losing allocation. Drop Gilbert, add $21 to the auction budget, and spend that money on a pitcher who produces at the same level for a Year 1 contract you control.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Combined impact of releasing all three: +$30 in auction budget, lifting LVA from $11 to $41. That's the difference between being a passive observer and a meaningful participant in the FA auction. Three drops, one strategic upgrade to the team's financial flexibility heading into the most important roster-building event of the year.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">The combined impact of dropping Musgrove, Bieber, and Gilbert is not losing three roster spots — it's buying your way back into the auction room. Eleven dollars gets you a coffee. Forty-one dollars gets you a starting pitcher.</blockquote>


  <span class="section-kicker">Auction Strategy</span>
  <h2>Free Agent Auction Strategy</h2>

  <p>Eleven dollars. Let's sit with that number for a moment. While <strong>Philadelphia</strong> waltzes into the 2026 FA Auction with $199, while <strong>Toronto</strong> clears $185 and <strong>Chicago</strong> brandishes $167, the defending 2024 champion is approaching the podium with something that barely covers a cab ride from the airport. This is the structural cost of roster excellence, and it demands both honesty and creativity to navigate.</p>

  <figure class="article-chart">
    <img src="charts/auction_budget_lva.png" alt="2026 FA Auction Budget — All Teams" style="width:100%;max-width:720px;display:block;margin:0 auto;">
    <figcaption>2026 FA Auction Budget — All Teams</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The first strategic imperative is to execute the drops outlined above. Releasing Musgrove, Bieber, and Gilbert adds $30 to the auction budget and takes LVA from $11 to $41. That's still the sixth-lowest in the league — but it's a functional number. You can do something meaningful with $41.</p>

  <p>The second strategic imperative is to forget about the headliners. Shohei Ohtani (680.5 FPts, the best player in the FA pool) will go for $60, $70, maybe more. <strong>Juan Soto</strong> — the very player DiMauro just released — will command something in the $60-80 range from a team with genuine spending power. <strong>Rafael Devers</strong> (522 FPts) will test the $30-40 range. These are not LVA targets. They are budget targets, and the teams with $130-199 to spend will own this auction's top tier.</p>

  <p>With $41 in available budget (assuming the three drops), here are the legitimate priority targets from the confirmed 2026 FA pool:</p>

  <p><strong>Gleyber Torres (2B/SS, 404.5 FPts)</strong> — There's a certain awkward poetry in re-acquiring the player you just cut, but Torres's multi-positional eligibility at 2B and SS is genuinely useful for LVA, which carries two SS-eligible players already (Lindor and Henderson) and could use infield versatility. In a deep auction with spenders dominating the top tier, Torres might settle in the $10-18 range — within reach for a team building on a budget.</p>

  <p><strong>Spencer Steer (1B/2B/3B/SS, 354.5 FPts)</strong> — Another familiar name: LVA traded Steer away in May 2025 to fund the Soto acquisition. He landed back in the FA pool with four-position eligibility and a productive season total. Steer is the kind of versatile, positionally flexible player that salary-constrained teams should target — he fills multiple roster spots, prevents punting positions, and should settle at a moderate auction price in the $10-15 range.</p>

  <p><strong>Oneil Cruz (SS, 353 FPts)</strong> — Elite power from a shortstop, which is a rare combination in any format. Cruz carries injury risk but is productive when available. In an auction where Cruz's fragility scares off bidding teams, DiMauro might catch him at $12-18 — legitimate value for a player with that upside.</p>

  <p><strong>Kevin Gausman or Zack Wheeler (SP, 451.5 and 446.5 FPts respectively)</strong> — The FA pool has legitimate starting pitcher depth. Both Gausman and Wheeler would represent immediate rotation upgrades and could replace the production lost from a Gilbert cut. They will likely go for $20-30+, which means DiMauro may need to choose one over the other if he's working with $41 total. The argument for prioritizing pitching is compelling: LVA's rotation loses Gilbert (if dropped), and Bieber and deGrom both carry health uncertainty.</p>

  <p>The optimal $41 spend looks something like: one SP at $18-22 (Gausman or a comparable arm), one multi-eligible hitter at $10-14 (Torres or Steer), and a $5-7 flier on a deeper pick. That sequence fills real roster holes and doesn't require outbidding anyone with $150+ in budget.</p>

  <p>One additional lever worth considering: DiMauro has proven adept at bidding on players and immediately trading them if the contract doesn't fit long-term. With $41 in budget, he could theoretically win a $35 bid on a player like <strong>Christian Yelich</strong> (462.5 FPts) or <strong>Mookie Betts</strong> (460 FPts) — both legitimate studs available in the FA pool — and flip them to a salary-capped team for prospects or a player on a more sustainable contract. It's a bold play, but DiMauro has executed that exact move before.</p>


  <span class="section-kicker">Draft Outlook</span>
  <h2>MiLB Draft Outlook</h2>

  <p>Las Vegas picks 16th in every round of the March 15-22 slow draft — the perennial price of excellence. With 7 of 10 MiLB slots currently filled, they have three picks available. The strategic decisions around those slots start before the draft even begins.</p>

  <p>The first question is <strong>Jackson Jobe</strong>. At 23 years old with real MLB production already on his ledger, Jobe is no longer truly a prospect in the developmental sense — he's a rotation-eligible player occupying a MiLB slot that could house an actual prospect. Promoting Jobe to the active roster before March 15 (when MiLB decisions lock) accomplishes two things simultaneously: it gives LVA a healthy arm in the starting rotation and opens a fourth draft slot, effectively turning three picks into four. If Musgrove is released, there's a SP vacancy on the active roster waiting for him.</p>

  <p>Similarly, if <strong>Max Clark</strong> is poised for an early-season MLB debut (which his evaluation profile strongly suggests), promoting him at the deadline to create a fifth pick slot is worth considering. The risk is losing the $0 salary benefit of having him in the MiLB slot for a few more weeks — but if he's going to produce 2026 fantasy points from April onward, locking that production in early is the smarter play.</p>

  <p>With 3-5 draft picks at position 16, LVA's haul will fall in the middle-to-back portion of each round's value distribution. The system is already loaded with position players (Clark, Rodriguez, Morales, Lile on the active roster). <strong>The priority should be pitching arms</strong> — specifically, high-upside starting pitcher prospects who may have fallen in the draft order due to organization uncertainty, volatility between scouting services, or the later positions that accrue to successful teams. A consensus top-100 arm at pick 16 in Rounds 1 or 2 is a legitimate win from this position.</p>

  <p>Secondary targets: speed-and-OBP position players who complement the existing power-heavy hitting core, and any name that surfaces as a consensus top-50 prospect in a class that happens to be available when LVA picks. At position 17 in the 2025 draft, DiMauro landed Max Clark (Round 8 retained) and Emmanuel Rodriguez (Round 7 retained) — the position matters less than identifying the right names.</p>


  <span class="section-kicker">The Verdict</span>
  <h2>2026 Season Prediction</h2>

  <p>The Las Vegas Athletics are a team entering 2026 with a paradox: they have one of the five best rosters in the league and one of the five lowest auction budgets. Those two facts will define everything about how this season plays out.</p>

  <p>The ceiling is genuine. <strong>Judge</strong>, <strong>Carroll</strong>, <strong>Henderson</strong>, <strong>Lindor</strong>, <strong>Rodon</strong>, and a healthy <strong>deGrom</strong> give this team a first-half floor that almost nothing in the league can match. If Max Clark arrives from the minors and produces at the level his evaluation suggests, LVA gets a $0-salary starter in the outfield that would cost $25+ via auction on any other roster. A healthy Bieber recaptures $7 worth of legitimate rotation production. The 2026 ceiling is another top-3 regular season finish and a deep playoff run.</p>

  <p>The floor is an injury cascade. DeGrom's history is real. Bieber just missed effectively an entire season. Rodon's durability will always carry an asterisk. Logan Gilbert — if kept — was a 25-start pitcher last year, not a 32-start pitcher. If two of those four rotation pieces miss significant time and LVA can't patch the holes through the auction or trades, the hitting dominance may not be enough to overcome rotation chaos in a format that rewards balance.</p>

  <p>DiMauro's trade activity in 2025 demonstrated that he doesn't wait for problems to solve themselves — he moves proactively, uses prospects as currency, and extracts value from situations that other managers don't recognize as opportunities. That instinct won't disappear. The question is whether the market has assets worth acquiring at prices LVA can manage.</p>

  <div class="prediction-box">
    <p><strong>Projected Record:</strong> 13-6 (regular season)</p>
    <p><strong>Projected Seed:</strong> #2 or #3</p>
    <p><strong>Playoff Odds:</strong> 85%</p>
    <p><strong>Championship Odds:</strong> 20–25% — top-3 contender, but rotation health is the swing variable</p>
    <p><strong>Ceiling:</strong> Back-to-back championship runs anchored by Judge and a healthy rotation</p>
    <p><strong>Floor:</strong> 10-9, first-round playoff exit if starting pitching breaks down</p>
    <p>Two seasons. 30 wins. Eight losses. One ring. Three Silver Slugger Awards. The Las Vegas Athletics have built the gold standard in The Sandlot Dynasty League in record time. The salary chart is steep, the auction budget is thin, and Juan Soto just walked out the door carrying 661 fantasy points with him — but this roster is still loaded, the farm still has a top-10 prospect waiting to graduate, and Mike DiMauro will make ten trades this summer when the rest of the league makes three. The party isn't over. It's just moved to a smaller venue.</p>
