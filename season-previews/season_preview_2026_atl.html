  <span class="section-kicker">Introduction</span>
  <h2>The Nuclear Option</h2>

  <p>In four seasons of Sandlot Dynasty League existence, the <strong>Atlanta Braves</strong> have swung from champion to rubble and back again — twice. Owner <strong>Justin Winward</strong> won it all in 2022, went 16-3 the following year only to flame out in the playoffs, cratered to a catastrophic 4-15 in 2024, then somehow reassembled a machine good enough to go 16-3 <em>again</em> in 2025 and claim the #1 overall seed. What happened next is the part that takes some explaining.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Atlanta faced Arizona in the divisional round of the 2025 playoffs and got obliterated, 563 to 749.5. The Diamondbacks — who limped into the postseason as the 8-seed — put up the kind of number that makes fantasy baseball feel briefly unfair. Arizona went on to win the championship. Winward went home and apparently did some very hard thinking.</p>

  <p>The conclusion he reached: blow it up. All of it. <strong>Shohei Ohtani</strong>, <strong>Mookie Betts</strong>, <strong>Zack Wheeler</strong>, <strong>Rafael Devers</strong>, <strong>Jose Altuve</strong>, <strong>Robert Suarez</strong>, <strong>Devin Williams</strong>, <strong>Luis Castillo</strong>, <strong>Christian Yelich</strong>, <strong>Brandon Nimmo</strong>, <strong>Austin Riley</strong> — all released. Seventeen players cut in total. A 16-3 roster, atomized. Justin Winward has entered 2026 with six keepers, $135 in auction budget, and either a master plan or a stunning act of self-sabotage. There is no middle ground here.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Season Context</span>
  <h2>2025 In-Season Moves</h2>

  <p>Before you can understand what Winward is building in 2026, you have to understand how he built — and then dismantled — what was one of the most star-laden rosters in TSDL history.</p>

  <p><strong>MiLB Draft:</strong> Atlanta entered the 2025 season carrying eight players retained from the prior year's minor league system: <strong>Josue De Paula</strong>, <strong>Marcelo Mayer</strong>, <strong>Hurston Waldrep</strong>, <strong>Travis Sykora</strong>, <strong>Andrew Painter</strong>, <strong>Jacob Misiorowski</strong>, <strong>Henry Lalane</strong>, and <strong>Jackson Ferris</strong>. Not a bad collection of arms and upside at all. With his two actual draft picks in the spring MiLB draft, Winward added <strong>Tomoyuki Sugano</strong> (Round 1, Pick 10) and <strong>Shotaro Morii</strong> (Round 2, Pick 28). Serviceable additions to a system already stocked with depth. The more consequential story, as it turned out, was that most of those retained prospects would be packaged as trade chips before summer's end — Winward was building a war chest, not a farm.</p>

  <p><strong>FA Auction:</strong> With a strong returning core already in place, Atlanta entered the 2025 auction with a clear plan. They deployed $147 strategically: <strong>Josh Hader</strong> at $44 to anchor the bullpen, <strong>Kyle Schwarber</strong> at $35 — a piece acquired specifically to flip as trade currency — <strong>Mike Trout</strong> at $30, <strong>Robert Suarez</strong> at $27, <strong>Yainer Diaz</strong> at $10 at catcher, and <strong>Joey Ortiz</strong> at $1 as depth. The Schwarber buy-and-flip maneuver was a classic dynasty move: identify a player worth more in a trade than his FAAB cost, pay the price, and immediately use him as currency. Winward executed it cleanly, turning Schwarber into Zack Wheeler within weeks of the auction closing.</p>

  <p><strong>In-Season Trades:</strong> And then the phone lines opened. Over the course of 2025, Winward orchestrated one of the most active trade runs in recent TSDL memory. The sequence:</p>

  <p>In April, he acquired <strong>Brandon Nimmo</strong>, <strong>Shohei Ohtani</strong>, and <strong>Luis Castillo</strong> from the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for <strong>Jack Leiter</strong>, <strong>Max Meyer</strong>, <strong>Reese Olson</strong>, and <strong>James Wood</strong>. That trade reads like a complete franchise pivot — four young pieces for three established contributors, with Ohtani as the centerpiece. The same month, he landed <strong>Nick Pivetta</strong>, <strong>Christian Yelich</strong>, and <strong>Sonny Gray</strong> from Chicago; acquired <strong>Jose Altuve</strong> from Philadelphia for MiLB prospect <strong>Andrew Painter</strong>; and sent Kyle Schwarber to the Cubs in exchange for <strong>Zack Wheeler</strong> and <strong>Vinnie Pasquantino</strong>.</p>

  <p>The mega-deal arrived in late June. Atlanta sent nine pieces — including MiLB prospects Mayer, Sykora, De Paula, and Misiorowski — to the Phillies and received <strong>Bobby Witt Jr.</strong>, <strong>Blake Snell</strong>, <strong>Bryce Harper</strong>, Pablo Lopez, Maikel Garcia, and additional minor league depth in return. July brought another haul from Colorado: <strong>Mookie Betts</strong>, <strong>Austin Riley</strong>, and <strong>Paul Goldschmidt</strong> arrived in exchange for Lopez, Pasquantino, Sean Manaea, and more farm pieces. August added <strong>Rafael Devers</strong> from the Yankees and <strong>Kenley Jansen</strong> from Boston for the stretch run. The result was a roster that looked like a fantasy superteam — and it produced like one. For two glorious months.</p>

  <p>Among the smarter moves of the season: acquiring top prospect <strong>Jett Williams</strong> from Washington in late July for a waiver-wire starter in Trevor Rogers. Winward gave up nothing meaningful and got back a genuine impact name. That deal alone may prove to be the most consequential transaction of Atlanta's entire 2025 season, even if it didn't show up in the box score until much later. <span class="grade">In-Season Grade: A&minus;</span></p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Season Analysis</span>
  <h2>2025 Season in Review</h2>

  <p>The 2025 regular season was a dominant performance from wire to wire. Atlanta opened 2-0, stumbled briefly to 2-1 after a Week 3 loss to Houston, and then spent the next sixteen weeks methodically working through the rest of the league. By Week 12, they were 9-3 and firmly entrenched at the top of the standings. By Week 16, they were 13-3. By the end of the regular season: 16-3, and the #1 seed for the second time in four years.</p>

  <p>The production was legitimately historic. Atlanta finished with 8,221.5 total fantasy points — against a league average of 6,683.4, a 23% advantage. The offense contributed 257 home runs, 784 RBI, 813 runs, and 122 steals. The pitching staff racked up 104 wins, 91 saves, 103 quality starts, and 1,475 strikeouts over 1,405.2 innings. In a league this competitive, those numbers reflect roster management executed almost perfectly.</p>

  <div class="stat-grid">
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Hitting FPts:</strong> 4,124.5<br><em>League avg: 3,584.5</em></div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Pitching FPts:</strong> 4,097.0<br><em>League avg: 3,098.9</em></div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>HR / RBI / SB:</strong> 257 / 784 / 122</div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>IP / K / SV:</strong> 1,405.2 / 1,475 / 91</div>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Shohei Ohtani</strong> led the roster with 680.5 FPts across 158 games — second in the entire league. <strong>Bobby Witt Jr.</strong> contributed 560.5 FPts at shortstop. <strong>Nick Pivetta</strong> posted 523 FPts in 31 starts. <strong>Rafael Devers</strong> added 522 FPts, <strong>Christian Yelich</strong> and <strong>Mookie Betts</strong> each cleared 460, and <strong>Bryce Harper</strong>, <strong>Jose Altuve</strong>, and <strong>Robert Suarez</strong> all contributed 428 or more. At full strength, there was no roster in TSDL that could match Atlanta's lineup depth.</p>

  <p>Then came the divisional round. Arizona arrived as the 8-seed riding a postseason wave, put up 749.5 points against Atlanta's 563, and exposed an uncomfortable reality: a team built for the sustained grind of a 19-week regular season is not the same thing as a team built for the high-variance cruelty of a two-week playoff series. Winward finished 5th overall — the same playoff outcome he'd suffered in 2023, also after a 16-3 regular season. The déjà vu apparently broke something loose.</p>

  <p>Among the bright spots from the in-season wire: <strong>Connelly Early</strong>, claimed off the waiver wire in September for just $7, posted 42.5 FPts across four appearances — a 10.6 FPts/G rate that earned him a keep heading into 2026. Four games is a limited sample, and the full-season FPts figure reflects his total 2025 stats rather than just post-acquisition output, but the per-game pace was compelling enough to justify a $2 roster spot.</p>

  </figure>

  <span class="section-kicker">Roster Reset</span>
  <h2>2025/2026 Offseason Roster Cuts</h2>

  <p>Seventeen players. Let that land for a moment. Justin Winward entered the offseason with a 16-3 team and chose to release seventeen of its components. Some cuts are defensible. A few are puzzling. And at least one will be debated in TSDL circles for years.</p>

  <p>Start with the financial architecture. The players Winward cut were not just expensive — they were expensive and escalating. <strong>Shohei Ohtani</strong> led the roster in 2025 with 680.5 FPts at a salary of $94. Next year: $95. The year after: $98. In a format where $260 is the auction ceiling and roster construction is everything, locking up 37% of your hypothetical cap in a single player is a slow-moving dynasty emergency. Winward looked at the trajectory and made the call: Ohtani walks. It is simultaneously the most understandable and most painful cut in this entire offseason purge. He was arguably the best player in the league last year. He's now a free agent.</p>

  <p>The rest of the cuts follow the same logic. <strong>Mookie Betts</strong> was heading to $60 at Year 5. <strong>Rafael Devers</strong> was at $54/Yr5. <strong>Zack Wheeler</strong> would have cost $48/Yr5. <strong>Austin Riley</strong> at $51/Yr5. <strong>Jose Altuve</strong> at $30/Yr5. Every one of these players was walking deeper into escalating-salary territory with no natural exit ramp. Taken collectively, keeping them all would have been mathmatically impossible, which Winward knew when he acquired each of those pieces — thus locking Atlanta into a declining, aging core with almost no flexibility to improve.</p>

  <p>Several cuts are harder to fully explain on salary grounds alone. <strong>Mike Trout</strong> was at just $30 for a Year 1 deal — he would have been $31 in 2026. His 345 FPts in 130 games represents genuine production. Cutting a Year 1 player still producing at that level suggests Winward either anticipated continued health concerns or simply wanted to take a clean break across the board rather than preserve individual pieces of a team he'd decided to rebuild. <strong>Robert Suarez</strong> ($27/Yr1, 436.5 FPts) was one of the better starters in TSDL last season — letting him hit the market is a real loss, though at $28 in Year 2 for a starting pitcher with a checkered injury history, the value-to-cost ratio does start to get complicated. <strong>Yainer Diaz</strong> ($10/Yr1, 327.5 FPts) produced well at catcher, and Atlanta now enters 2026 with zero catchers on the active roster. That's a significant positional hole to fill at auction against several other teams with fewer holes to fill and larger budgets. It's unlikely Atlanta sees the same kind of production in 2026 from the catcher position as they did in 2025.</p>

  <p>The cuts that require no defense: <strong>Jordan Leasure</strong>, <strong>Jacob Lopez</strong>, and <strong>Robert Hassell</strong> were all Year 1 waiver-type acquisitions that were never going to be carried forward. Cleaning those up is standard offseason hygiene, not strategy.</p>

  <p>The broader picture: Winward looked at the escalating salary commitments of an aging championship-caliber roster, weighed them against a playoff result that was humbling at best and devastating at worst, and chose to reset entirely rather than pay compounding costs for a diminishing window. Whether that was the right call depends entirely on what he builds next month.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">Winward cut the league's best player rather than pay $95 a year. The all-in moves of 2025 will be viewed as either the smartest management in TSDL history or they could lead to a multi-season rebuild everyone will be talking about for years. Possibly both.</blockquote>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Roster</span>
  <h2>The Core — Returning Players</h2>

  <p>Six players. That's what remains. The 2026 salary chart above maps Atlanta's $125 in keeper commitments across a small but carefully considered group — all retained because Winward believes they represent dynasty-level upside, team-friendly cost structures, or both. Here is who survived the purge, and why.</p>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Bobby Witt Jr.</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SS | 2026 Cost: $43 | Contract Year 5</div>
    <p><strong>Bobby Witt Jr.</strong> is the untouchable. He posted 560.5 FPts across 157 games in 2025 — 3.57 FPts per game from the shortstop position, one of the most competitive and premium spots in any dynasty format. He is, without question, the singular player this roster is built around rather than built away from. Yes, at Year 5 he's heading to $48 in 2027 and climbing $5 per year from there — the natural escalation of TSDL contracts will eventually price him out. But you do not release the best shortstop in baseball when he's 24 years old and posting 560-point seasons. Not now. Witt is the franchise cornerstone. Everything else is context.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Nick Pivetta</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP | 2026 Cost: $19 | Contract Year 2</div>
    <p><strong>Nick Pivetta</strong> is the most value-rich contract on this roster, and it isn't close. He posted 523 FPts across 31 starts in 2025 — 16.87 FPts per game, one of the better per-start marks in the league. He's entering Year 2 at $19 and doesn't climb to $22 until 2027. For a starting pitcher producing at ace-level rates, $19 is the kind of contract that makes opposing owners uncomfortable. Pivetta is the rotation anchor. If the rebuilt roster has a floor, Witt and Pivetta are where it's built from.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Bryce Harper</div>
    <div class="player-meta">1B | 2026 Cost: $39 | Contract Year 4</div>
    <p>One important note about <strong>Bryce Harper</strong>: in the 2026 TSDL system, he is eligible at first base only. Not outfield. This is a meaningful roster construction constraint — it means Atlanta is paying $39 for a player locked into a single position, and any additional 1B-eligible bat acquired at auction creates lineup stacking issues. His 428.5 FPts in 132 games (3.25/G) is genuine star-level production, and at Year 4 heading to $44, the salary trajectory is manageable for another year or two. But the position lock is real, and it shapes how the rest of the roster gets built around him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Brandon Woodruff</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP | 2026 Cost: $5 | Contract Year 3</div>
    <p>At $5, <strong>Brandon Woodruff</strong> is the most intriguing speculative keep in the entire league. He managed only 12 starts in 2025, but when he was on the mound, he was exceptional: 207.5 FPts, 17.29 FPts per game — the best per-start rate of any Atlanta arm. The salary is so low that even a 15-start season delivers enormous value. The question is entirely one of health; Woodruff has struggled to stay on the field at various points in his career, and the 12-start limitation in 2025 raises legitimate flags. But at $5 for an ace-caliber pitcher when healthy, and jumping only to $10 next year at Year 4? You keep him and hope. This is the window.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The remaining two keepers are smaller bets. <strong>Blake Snell</strong> ($17/Yr5) made just 11 starts in 2025 — a concerning number for a pitcher now entering Year 5 of a contract that climbs to $22 in 2027. His 14.27 FPts per start is outstanding production when he actually takes the ball. But "when he actually takes the ball" has been the defining uncertainty of Snell's career for several seasons running. He is either the steal of the offseason or a roster weight that compounds every time he lands on the IL, and with signs pointing to him starting the season on the IL he may find himself squeezed off of Atlanta's roster before the March 15 deadline. <strong>Connelly Early</strong> ($2/Yr2) is a near-free lottery ticket — four appearances, 10.6 FPts/G, and a spot that costs essentially nothing to carry. Winward will hope his shrewd FAAB pickup continues to pay dividends in 2026.</p>

  <p>Total 2026 keeper salary: <strong>$125</strong>. Available auction budget: <strong>$135</strong>. In a league where the average team has already committed most of their cap to keepers, Atlanta is one of only five teams entering the auction with more than $120 to spend. That is a major structural advantage — however, Atlanta also has more roster spots to fill than any other team in the league. They have the ability to be players in any of the top names in the auction, but leaving less than 20%-25% of their budget to fill 15 or so roster spots may not play to their advantage.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Minors</span>
  <h2>Farm Report</h2>

  <p>The Atlanta farm system is thin by design. Winward spent most of his prospect capital during the 2025 trade deadline run — Mayer, Sykora, De Paula, Misiorowski, Painter, Ferris, and Ricky Tiedemann were all packaged as salary fodder in the consolidation trades that built last year's superteam. Wood and Misiorowski hurt the most, particularly as Atlanta will have to watch them perform with rival Philadelphia for years to come. What remains though is a small but surprisingly interesting collection.</p>

  <p><strong>Hurston Waldrep</strong> (23) is the most advanced piece in the system. He was called up at some point in 2025 and posted 157.5 FPts across 10 appearances — roughly 15.75 FPts per game, which is ace-level production for any context. He doesn't carry a traditional prospect ranking at this stage, which suggests he is approaching or past the point where he needs to either occupy an active roster slot or get moved. If Waldrep is healthy and on the Braves' major league staff in 2026, he could be a legitimate rotation contributor starting in April. The key decision for Winward: convert him to the active roster before the March 15 call-up deadline and open an additional MiLB slot, or continue to hold him as a minor leaguer and risk leaving production on the table.</p>

  <p><strong>Jett Williams</strong> (22) is the real jewel — and probably the most important acquisition Atlanta made in all of 2025, hiding in plain sight inside a late-July trade with Washington. Williams checks in as a consensus top-60 prospect by the leading scouting systems: ranking as high as #40, and as low as #72, and the consensus lands around #56. That's a genuinely impactful young player at a premium defensive position. He's 22 years old, he plays shortstop, and he's the kind of foundational prospect Atlanta desperately needed after trading away so much depth. The timeline on Williams reaching the majors is plausibly early 2026 or mid-2026 after being dealt to the rebuilding White Sox where there will be less competition for an MLB roster spot. The longer he stays in the minor leagues, Winward is getting free production potential from a top-75 prospect. That's a genuine win.</p>

  <p><strong>Shotaro Morii</strong> (19) is a longer-term project — a Japanese outfield prospect who was the Round 2 pick in the 2025 MiLB draft. He's outside the consensus top 200 at this stage and carries no TSDL production to evaluate. At 19, he's a multi-year developmental stash, the kind of player you hold with patience and revisit in 2028. The upside is real in the abstract; the timeline is long.</p>

  <p>Overall: a thin system with two interesting names. Waldrep is a near-term contributor who may already have cleared the prospect threshold, though injuries are once again threatening his 2026 season. Williams is a legitimate dynasty asset at a premium position. Morii is a long-horizon lottery ticket. Winward has seven open MiLB slots heading into the March draft — expect him to be aggressive in filling them. Farm Grade: <span class="grade">C-</span></p>

  <h2>Drop Watch</h2>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Blake Snell — SP | $17 / Year 5</strong><br>
    Eleven starts. That is the defining number of Blake Snell's 2025 season, and it is the number that will haunt every conversation about this contract going forward. His 14.27 FPts per start is genuinely elite — when Snell pitches, he is one of the better arms in this league. The problem is "when Snell pitches" has become a genuine qualifier rather than a given. At Year 5 and climbing to $22 in 2027 and a real possibility of starting the season on the IL (again), this is a contract that needs to deliver meaningful innings volume to justify the spot. With $135 in auction budget and the free agent market loaded with healthy starting pitchers, Winward has optionality he doesn't usually have. Snell is worth keeping at $17 for now — but if he's not in a rotation by May or June, the conversation changes quickly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Connelly Early — SP | $2 / Year 2</strong><br>
    Four appearances, 10.6 FPts/G, $2 salary — the case for keeping Early is simple: the downside is almost nothing. The case for dropping him is equally simple: four games is not a statistically meaningful sample, and if Early doesn't hold a rotation spot in 2026, the active roster slot may be better used on a guaranteed contributor acquired at auction. At $2, the decision is borderline irrelevant financially. The real question is whether he's someone's fifth starter or a long reliever — and that answer won't be clear until spring training shakes out. Keep him, pay the $2, and reassess by mid-April.</p>
  </div>

  <span class="section-kicker">Auction Strategy</span>
  <h2>Free Agent Auction Strategy</h2>

  <p>This is where the 2026 season gets decided for Atlanta. With $135 in available budget — the fifth most in the league — Winward has the purchasing power to do serious damage at the auction table. There is also a compelling irony baked into his situation: the seventeen players he released this offseason just became the 2026 free agent pool. He created his own competition. The question now is whether he can buy back the pieces he needs at prices lower than what it would have cost to keep them, and the answer is: unlikely.</p>

  <p>The league's confirmed free agent pool is loaded. <strong>Shohei Ohtani</strong> leads the list with 680.5 FPts in 2025 and no active 2026 contract — Atlanta cut him, and he's now the most coveted player in the auction. He will command north of $80, probably significantly higher. Philadelphia ($199 budget), Toronto ($185), and Chicago ($167) all have the spending power to drive him past anything that makes long-term dynasty sense. The emotional pull of getting Ohtani back will be immense. Resist it. Let someone else overpay for the privilege, and focus on the six or seven other impact players available at more reasonable entry points.</p>

  <p>Here is where the $135 should actually go:</p>

  <p><strong>Juan Soto (OF, 661.5 FPts)</strong> — The best available hitter who was not on Atlanta's roster last year. Soto is the ideal Year 1 acquisition for a team resetting its entire payroll: elite production, generational upside, and a fresh contract clock. He fills the outfield depth Atlanta desperately needs after cutting Betts, Yelich, Nimmo, and Trout. Expect intense bidding from every budget-rich team. Atlanta should be willing to go $45–65 to land him — this is the kind of player you build the auction around. They likely won't be involved at that price, but if injuries during Spring Training lower his draft stock, Winward may be able to sneak in and add Soto's bat to anchor his lineup.</p>

  <p><strong>Yainer Diaz (C, 327.5 FPts)</strong> — Atlanta currently has zero catchers on the 2026 active roster. The catcher market in this auction is thin: Diaz is the clear best option, fresh off a 327.5-point season and available at Year 1 reset after Atlanta cut him at $10. Getting him back at $15–22 makes considerable sense. Do not let the catching position get addressed through waiver desperation in April.</p>

  <p><strong>Zack Wheeler (SP, 446.5 FPts)</strong> — Another player Atlanta cut, available at Year 1 reset. Wheeler was heading to $48 at Year 5 — genuinely difficult to justify. But at Year 1 in the auction, he's a legitimate ace-caliber starting pitcher who just posted 446 FPts in 24 starts. Given Snell and Woodruff's health questions, Atlanta needs rotation insurance, and Wheeler at $22–32 is exactly that. This is the rotation piece that insulates the staff against the injury risks already baked into the keeper set.</p>

  <p><strong>Willy Adames (SS, 445.5 FPts)</strong> — Bobby Witt Jr. is locked in at shortstop, so Adames won't start there. But at 445.5 FPts projected he'd fit in fine at Util, he adds genuine lineup depth for a team that currently has Witt at SS and Harper at 1B — and almost nothing else established on the infield. Adames at $18–28 gives Atlanta the middle-infield flexibility to handle any keeper injuries without falling into roster crisis.</p>

  <p>Two players to approach with explicit caution. <strong>Emmanuel Clase</strong> posted 278 FPts in 2025 but is currently facing a gambling-related suspension with no clear resolution timeline. Do not invest real money in an uncertain return date. <strong>Camilo Doval</strong> is coming off Tommy John surgery and is not expected back until 2027 — dynasty stash only at a minimal bid, or skip entirely.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">Atlanta spent the offseason creating its own best competition. But with $135 to spend and the fifth-largest auction budget in the league, they have every tool needed to rebuild faster than anyone expects.</blockquote>

  <p>On the supplemental side, several currently-rostered players may hit the market before auction day. <strong>Jose Ramirez</strong> (SDP, $71/Yr5) and <strong>Yordan Alvarez</strong> (SDP, $66/Yr5) are both deep into expensive contracts on a San Diego team already carrying a negative auction budget — if either gets cut, Atlanta's spending power makes them viable targets. <strong>Matt Olson</strong> (HOU, $47/Yr5) faces similar dynamics on a Houston roster also over its cap limit. These are secondary plans, not guaranteed opportunities, but Winward should have bid ranges ready for all three.</p>

  <p>The bottom line on budget allocation: Atlanta needs to fill roughly 17 active roster spots from the auction and waivers. The smart play is to concentrate $90–110 on four to six impact acquisitions — the anchor bid (Soto or Devers?), rotation insurance (Wheeler), catching (Diaz), and one more outfield bat — then fill the remaining slots with $1 depth from the deep tail of the free agent pool. Undershooting the $135 is not a strategy. Unused auction budget does not carry over, and every dollar left on the table is roster depth left on the table.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Draft</span>
  <h2>MiLB Draft Outlook</h2>

  <p>Atlanta picks #11 in the 2026 MiLB draft and carries seven open minor league slots. That combination of mid-first-round positioning and abundant roster room makes this one of the more important drafts in the organization's short history — particularly given how thoroughly the farm was stripped during last year's win-now push.</p>

  <p>The priority decision before the draft: what to do with <strong>Hurston Waldrep</strong>. If Winward converts him to the active roster by the March 15 deadline, a MiLB slot opens for an additional draft pick. Same if Waldrep is cut from the roster. Given Waldrep's major league production in 2025 — 157.5 FPts across 10 appearances — and his confirmed injury status, keeping him classified as a minor leaguer is an inefficient use of a precious slot. Converting him frees up capacity and acknowledges the reality that he's a contributor, not a stash. Make the move.</p>

  <p>At pick #11, Atlanta won't land a consensus top-50 prospect — but that territory contains legitimate second-tier talent capable of contributing within two to three years. Given the gaps in the active roster, the farm draft should emphasize outfield and pitching prospects, with an eye toward any catcher who could develop into a long-term solution behind the plate. The active roster will almost certainly have a purchased catcher from the auction, but having a developmental backstop in the system adds depth and reduces auction pressure at the position in future years.</p>

  <p>One philosophy to keep in mind: after a year of trading away established farm pieces for aging stars, this draft is ground-floor construction. Take swings on upside. A consensus top-75 prospect available at pick #11 has more long-term value than a safer, more polished player ranked 150th. Atlanta's farm needs high ceilings more than it needs floor.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Prediction</span>
  <h2>2026 Season Prediction</h2>

  <div class="prediction-box">
    <p><strong>Projected Record: 10–9 to 13–6</strong></p>
    <p>Justin Winward has done this before: built a roster from the ground up, traded aggressively into contention, and fielded a team capable of finishing first in a competitive 18-team league. He did it in 2022 and again — from a 4-15 disaster — in 2025. There is every reason to believe he can do it once more, faster than skeptics will expect.</p>
    <p>The 2026 season hinges on two variables. First: auction execution. If Winward lands Soto or Devers as his headline acquisition and deploys the remaining $90+ intelligently across the rotation and outfield, Atlanta can be a legitimate 11- to 13-win team with playoff positioning. Second: pitcher health. <strong>Brandon Woodruff</strong> at $5 and <strong>Blake Snell</strong> at $17 are both question marks — if either misses significant time, the pitching burden falls on <strong>Nick Pivetta</strong> and whatever starters Winward acquires in the auction. That might be manageable but certainly is not comfortable.</p>
    <p>The floor scenario — the auction underwhelms, Snell and Woodruff miss extended time — and Atlanta finishes below .500 and spends another year outside the playoff bracket. The ceiling scenario — Winward wins the auction, the pitching staff stays reasonably healthy, and <strong>Bobby Witt Jr.</strong> produces another MVP-caliber season — is a 13-win team that makes noise in October.</p>
    <p><strong>The Bold Call:</strong> Atlanta rebounds faster than the keeper count suggests. Winward is too savvy a builder to stay down long, and the $135 auction budget is a genuine structural weapon in a league where half the teams are already broke before Opening Day. The Braves make the playoffs. But until they figure out how to actually win in October — a puzzle that has eluded this franchise twice with dominant regular-season rosters — <strong>the championship ceiling stays locked.</strong> Final prediction: <strong>12–7, 4th seed, divisional round exit</strong> — and another offseason of hard questions.</p>
    <p>The Braves are back. The question is whether being back is enough.</p>
