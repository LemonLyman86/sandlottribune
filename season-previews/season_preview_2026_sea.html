    <figcaption>Seattle Mariners — Season History</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Jordan Britton's Seattle Mariners have been one of the TSDL's most compelling teams for four seasons — consistently competitive, occasionally brilliant, and perpetually on the edge of something great without quite reaching the mountaintop. The 2025 campaign was their finest regular season yet: 15-4, 6,250.5 fantasy points, third seed in a league of 18. They swept past Houston in the divisional round with genuine authority. Then came the conference semifinal against St. Louis — a 50-point loss, 564–614, tight enough to sting — and then the Las Vegas third-place game, a 255-point blowout that the team's PR department would prefer everyone simply forget (484–739.5, if you're keeping score at home).</p>

  <p>Four years. Three playoff appearances. Zero championships. The Mariners are a franchise that consistently shows up to the final table but has yet to drag the hardware home. That narrative either changes in 2026 or it calcifies into something more permanent and more damning.</p>

    <div class="stat-item"><span class="stat-label">Auction Budget</span><span class="stat-value">$0</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The good news: the pitching staff is legitimately elite — Cy Young Award-winning elite, with 4,206.5 pitching fantasy points in 2025, the best mark in the league. The bad news: the roster is maxed out at precisely $260 in keeper salary, leaving Jordan with exactly $0 to spend at the FA auction. Every roster decision from now until March 22 is a zero-sum transaction. Every player dropped is a dollar earned back. The math is unforgiving, the window is narrow, and the competition at the auction will be spending like they found a briefcase full of cash.</p>

  <p>This is a team capable of winning the TSDL in 2026. But first it has to solve itself.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">2025 Activity</span>
  <h2>2025 In-Season Moves</h2>

  <p>The 2025 Seattle offseason began, as every dynasty season does, with the MiLB slow draft. Jordan held the 11th pick in each of 10 rounds and deployed those selections with a philosophy that can best be described as aggressive monetization: the farm system existed primarily as currency for in-season trades, not as a patient developmental pipeline.</p>

  <p>Seven of the ten picks were new additions: <strong>Brandon Sproat</strong> (Round 1), <strong>Tirso Ornelas</strong> (Round 2), <strong>Seaver King</strong> (Round 3), <strong>Angel Genao</strong> (Round 4), <strong>Carlson Reed</strong> (Round 5), <strong>Braylon Payne</strong> (Round 6), and <strong>Chen-Wei Lin</strong> (Round 7). Three veterans — <strong>Drew Gilbert</strong>, <strong>Aidan Miller</strong>, and <strong>Jake Eder</strong> — were retained from the prior year's MiLB roster without using draft picks. Of those ten total MiLB assets, six were converted into trade chips before the 2025 regular season ended: Sproat to Philadelphia in May, Seaver King to Boston in May, Angel Genao to Washington before the season even started, Carlson Reed to Milwaukee in late July, Aidan Miller to Philadelphia in May, and Jake Eder to the Cubs in July. That's efficiency, or it's recklessness, depending on how 2026 goes.</p>

  <p>The FA auction in the spring was headline-making at the top: <strong>Chris Sale</strong> at $54, a bold bet on an aging ace who was immediately slotted as the rotation's hired gun for the playoff push. Total auction spend was $60 — deliberate restraint that reflected confidence in an already-loaded roster. <strong>Dustin May</strong> ($3), <strong>Carlos Santana</strong> ($2), and <strong>Jordan Hicks</strong> ($1) rounded out the additions. With $200 left unspent, Jordan made the pragmatic choice that a maxed-out keeper roster doesn't need a feeding frenzy at the auction — and banked that discipline for a later reckoning that has now, somewhat ironically, arrived.</p>

  <p>What followed during the regular season was a trading blitz that rivaled anything this franchise has done in four years. Jordan executed more than fifteen trades in 2025, and the activity peaked at a near-absurd level on August 1st, when at least five separate deals were consummated in a single day. The highlights: <strong>Freddy Peralta</strong> arrived from New York in June for Tyler Glasnow, a swap that looks better with each month that passes. <strong>Josh Naylor</strong> came over from Boston in an August package involving Shane McClanahan — who was immediately passed through to Colorado in exchange for Pablo Lopez — while <strong>Nico Hoerner</strong> was plucked from the Cubs alongside Will Smith for Byron Buxton and Addison Barger. <strong>Andrew Abbott</strong>, quietly acquired from Las Vegas in April for Joe Musgrove and Spencer Steer, turned out to be the heist of the year. <strong>Ryan Weathers</strong> arrived from Miami for Adolis Garcia, adding a young arm at minimal cost.</p>

  <p>The Chris Sale experiment closed when Jordan flipped him back to the Yankees for <strong>Luis Robert Jr.</strong> on August 1st — a bold swing at outfield upside that ultimately didn't survive the offseason roster crunch. The overall grade for Jordan's 2025 strategy: <strong>A&minus;</strong>. He identified inefficiencies, moved assets with purpose, and assembled a genuinely dominant roster. The playoff finish and the hollowed farm system prevent a perfect score — but this was an education in trade deadline aggression.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Season Analysis</span>
  <h2>2025 Season in Review</h2>

  <p>Let's be clear about what the 2025 regular season was: a masterpiece. The 15-4 record placed Seattle third in a league of 18, behind only Atlanta (16-3) and Las Vegas (also 15-4 on tiebreakers). Total production of 6,250.5 fantasy points was the third-highest mark in the league. The pitching staff was an industrial machine — 1,544.2 innings pitched, 101 wins, 53 saves, 95 quality starts, and 1,534 strikeouts — numbers that paced nearly every pitching category and earned the team the 2025 Cy Young Award with 4,206.5 pitching fantasy points. The Yeah-Yeah Award also came home to Seattle, adding a second trophy to an increasingly decorated shelf.</p>

  <p>The weekly progression was remarkable. Seattle opened 3-0, stumbled with a 12.5-point loss to San Diego in Week 4 (the narrowest defeat of the entire regular season), and then launched into one of the most sustained dominant stretches this franchise has ever produced. From Week 5 through Week 15 — eleven weeks — they lost exactly once, spending most of that stretch in the #1 power ranking position. Three losses in Weeks 16-18 dimmed the final regular-season stretch, but 15-4 entering the playoffs as the third seed remained an exceptional achievement by any measure.</p>

  <div class="stat-grid">
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Hitting FPts:</strong> 3,744.0 (197 HR, 130 SB, 701 RBI)</div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Pitching FPts:</strong> 4,206.5 (1,534 K, 101 W, 53 SV)</div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Best Win Margin:</strong> +118.5 vs Washington (Wk 2)</div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Closest Loss:</strong> &minus;12.5 vs San Diego (Wk 4)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The postseason told a more complicated story. Houston fell in the divisional round, 652–618 — a two-week battle that required genuine effort to close. Then the Cardinals arrived in the conference semifinal and extracted a 50-point win, 614–564. Fine margins, a winnable series. And then the Las Vegas third-place game. The Athletics — who had finished second in the regular season and would claim third in the final standings — produced 739.5 points in their two-week run while Seattle managed 484. A 255-point deficit. That's not a near miss; that's a statement from a rival that Seattle will need to reckon with in 2026.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">The pitching staff won the Cy Young Award, and the team still finished fourth. That's not an indictment of the rotation — it's an indictment of what happens when elite pitching carries an offense that occasionally goes quiet in the biggest moments.</blockquote>

  <p>The best in-season acquisition was <strong>Trevor Story</strong>, plucked off the waiver wire for $5 FAAB on July 1st and delivered 465.0 total FPts across 157 games at 3.0 FPts/G from the shortstop position. That five-dollar bet is now a $18 keeper contract for 2026 — a sign of Jordan's confidence in Story's ongoing value, though it also raises some questions we'll address in the Drop Watch section.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Roster Moves</span>
  <h2>Offseason Roster Cuts</h2>

  <p>With nineteen active players consuming the entire $260 keeper budget, Jordan entered the offseason with no room for the kind of selective roster trimming that most teams use to create flexibility. The four cuts he made were largely forced by the math rather than strategic preference — and at least two of them sting more than they should.</p>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Patrick Bailey, C — $1 / Year 1 — 203.5 FPts</strong> — A legitimate young catcher with solid production at Year 1 pricing. The $1 cost and defensible output make this a painful release rather than an obvious one. But with nineteen other players consuming every available dollar, the arithmetic left Bailey on the wrong side of the ledger. Catchers are the position most addressable through free agency, which made Bailey the squeezed-out choice rather than a true evaluation failure.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Ke'Bryan Hayes, 3B — $4 / Year 1 — 266.5 FPts</strong> — Solid production at third base at minimal cost, but squeezed out by the same salary crunch. The release creates a genuine positional gap — Seattle enters 2026 thin at 3B with no clear incumbent, a hole that will need to be addressed at the FA auction or through in-season transactions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Will Smith, C — $20 / Year 1 — 330.5 FPts</strong> — The smart cut. Acquired from the Cubs in the August 1st trade package alongside Nico Hoerner, Smith posted 330.5 FPts across 110 games. But retaining him at $20 into Year 2 for a catcher — especially when that $20 could instead be deployed in the FA auction — doesn't make economic sense. This is the right call, and it's one of the few concrete examples of financial discipline from an offseason that otherwise added up to a fully maxed-out payroll.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Pablo Lopez, SP — $16 / Year 4 — 179.5 FPts</strong> — Lopez arrived from Colorado in the August 1st trade cascade and struggled badly, producing only 179.5 FPts in a limited role. At $16 heading toward $21 in Year 5, the value proposition dissolved immediately. He's gone, and Jordan should have no regrets about this one.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Roster</span>
  <h2>The Core — Returning Players</h2>

  <p>The salary map above tells the story visually: this is a roster that spent aggressively through the 2025 trade deadline and is now paying the accumulated bill. The cool-hued bars at the low end represent the genuine bargains — <strong>Yamamoto</strong>, <strong>Abbott</strong>, and <strong>Crow-Armstrong</strong> in Year 2 and Year 3 contracts that are still years away from becoming financial burdens. The taller bars on the right represent the commitments that define this roster's ceiling and its constraints simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Total keeper salary: $260. Available auction budget: $0. This is a maxed-out roster in every sense of the phrase — and the first order of business is acknowledging what that means before discussing what's great about it.</p>

  <p>Start where any evaluation of this team should start: the pitching staff.</p>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Yoshinobu Yamamoto</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP | 2026 Cost: $5 | Contract Year 3 → $10 in 2027</div>
    <p>The most valuable contract on this roster, and possibly in the entire league. Yamamoto posted 496.5 FPts at 16.55 FPts/G across 30 starts — one of the best per-start averages in the TSDL — while costing $5. He escalates to $10 next year, then $15, then $20. By the time his salary becomes a genuine consideration, he will have delivered five or six elite seasons at a fraction of market rate. The fact that Jordan locked this contract down at Year 3 is the foundational advantage of this entire franchise. Protect it at all costs.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Andrew Abbott</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP | 2026 Cost: $4 | Contract Year 2 → $7 in 2027</div>
    <p>The stealth heist of the 2025 season. Acquired from Las Vegas in April for Musgrove and Steer — both of whom promptly disappeared — Abbott delivered 394.5 FPts at 13.6 FPts/G across 29 starts. He's a top-tier starter performing at ace-caliber efficiency on a contract that escalates to $7 next year and $12 the year after. Jordan should be treating this the same way he treats Yamamoto: as an untouchable building block around which everything else is constructed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Logan Webb</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP | 2026 Cost: $61 | Contract Year 4 → $66 in 2027</div>
    <p>The team's leading scorer in 2025 at 513 FPts, 15.09 FPts/G across 34 starts — the unambiguous ace and the Cy Young anchor. And yes, $61. A single player consuming 23% of the entire keeper budget. Webb escalates to $66 in Year 5, then $71 in Year 6. In 2026, he's still justified as an investment in ace-level production. But the Webb contract will eventually become the defining tension of this roster's reconstruction window, and Jordan should be planning for that moment now — not the day it arrives. For this season: he stays, he anchors, and he's worth it. Ask again in twelve months.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Freddy Peralta</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP | 2026 Cost: $36 | Contract Year 4 → $41 in 2027</div>
    <p>The trade of the 2025 season. Peralta arrived from New York in June for Tyler Glasnow and delivered 508 FPts at 15.39 FPts/G — a legitimate above-average ace performing on the same tier as Webb. At $36 heading to Year 5 ($41 next winter), he's approaching the upper bound of defensible value, but for 2026 he remains a genuine asset. The four-man rotation of Webb, Peralta, Yamamoto, and Abbott is the best starting staff in this league. Full stop. No qualifications necessary.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The position player core is led by <strong>Josh Naylor</strong> ($17/Year 5, 492.5 FPts, 1B-eligible), an iron-man who appeared in 147 games and delivered consistent run and RBI production. <strong>Pete Crow-Armstrong</strong> ($5/Year 3, 492.5 FPts, OF-eligible) is arguably even more impressive per dollar — matching Naylor's total production across 157 outfield appearances at $5. He's the position player version of the Yamamoto contract: locked in at an extraordinary price for the next three years.</p>

  <p><strong>Nico Hoerner</strong> ($15/Year 5, 459.5 FPts, eligible at 2B) and <strong>Trevor Story</strong> ($18/Year 4, 465 FPts, SS-eligible) anchor the middle infield. Both are productive, though both raise salary questions heading into their next contract years — Hoerner at $20/Year 6 next winter, Story at $23/Year 5. <strong>Jeremy Pena</strong> ($15/Year 5, SS-eligible, 403.5 FPts across 125 games) adds middle infield depth, though his production is average at a position with a deep free agent class available this spring.</p>

  <p>Beyond the top tier, the roster carries some weight that deserves honest scrutiny. <strong>Nick Lodolo</strong> ($16/Year 5, 373 FPts in 29 starts) provides rotation depth as a reliable if unspectacular fifth starter. <strong>Pete Fairbanks</strong> ($20/Year 3, RP, 319.5 FPts) is an average reliever earning reliever-premium dollars. <strong>Mitch Keller</strong> ($15/Year 4, SP, 308 FPts across 32 starts) is the rotation's below-average sixth option, paid like a rotation starter.</p>

  <p>And then there's <strong>Zach Eflin</strong> ($15/Year 5, SP) — who appeared in just 14 games in 2025 for 124 FPts. Eflin at $15 on an injury-shortened season of 14 starts is the most straightforward roster decision on this team. He's also the most obvious first step toward unlocking any auction budget whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Depth pieces like <strong>Blaze Alexander</strong> (3B-eligible, $2/Year 2, 138 FPts), <strong>Brandon Marsh</strong> (OF-eligible, $2/Year 2, 266 FPts), and <strong>Jeremiah Jackson</strong> (OF-eligible, $2/Year 2, 103 FPts across 48 games) fill cheap roster slots without providing the lineup depth that would make this team genuinely dangerous in the postseason. <strong>Ryan Weathers</strong> ($5/Year 3, SP, 70.5 FPts in only 8 appearances) has genuine upside as a young arm but contributed minimally in 2025 and enters 2026 as a projection play more than a reliable contributor.</p>

  <p>The $0 auction context is the elephant that sits on every roster analysis for this team. Philadelphia enters 2026 with $199 to spend. Toronto has $185. Chicago has $167. These teams are going to reshape their rosters through the auction in ways that Seattle simply cannot match unless Jordan makes some hard calls. The pitching staff is elite enough to anchor a title run — but it needs a lineup that can actually score, and the current roster's offensive construction is not obviously sufficient.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Minors</span>
  <h2>Farm Report — Minor League Roster</h2>

  <p>The minor league system tells the story of a team that went all-in on 2025 and used its farm as the primary payment mechanism. Of the ten MiLB assets Jordan held entering last season — seven new draft picks plus three retained keepers — six were converted into trade chips before the season ended. What remains is a lean system of four players, ranging from legitimate prospect to deep-organizational speculation.</p>

  <p><strong>Drew Gilbert</strong> (25, OF) is the system's present and most actionable piece. A consensus top-200 prospect independently validated by two scouting sources (ranked in the 158-159 range on both), Gilbert has already logged 59 FPts across 39 MLB games. For a retained keeper entering his age-25 season, he's approaching the crossroads moment — he either establishes himself in the big leagues or begins the quiet fade into journeyman territory. His performance in 2026 spring training will be the most important development variable for this system. A call-up opportunity could realistically arrive in April or May, depending on how the season unfolds.</p>

  <p><strong>Braylon Payne</strong> (19) is the system's high-ceiling flier. A Round 6 pick from the 2025 draft, Payne is consensus-ranked in the 139-188 range across two independent sources — a teenager with the kind of tools and development runway that dynasty rosters are built to accommodate. He is not a 2026 factor. He is a 2028-2029 stash. But for a system that needs young talent badly, his presence is meaningful.</p>

  <p><strong>Tirso Ornelas</strong> (25, Round 2 pick) is the system's most uncertain quantity. One evaluative system puts him around #454, with no second source to validate or challenge the mark. At 25, the prospect grace period is running out — Ornelas needs to force his way into a big league conversation in the near term or the dynasty case evaporates. He's a speculative hold at best, a name to move in a trade if the right offer materializes.</p>

  <p><strong>Chen-Wei Lin</strong> (24, Round 7 pick) checks in around #788 on one system with no corroboration. He's an organizational arm at the back of the pipeline — the kind of low-probability dart throw that late-round MiLB picks represent.</p>

  <p>Farm Grade: <span class="grade">D+</span> The 2025 deadline drained this system in service of a playoff push that ended in a fourth-place finish. What remains has one legitimate top-200 piece in Gilbert, one exciting teenage name in Payne, and two speculative stashes. The 2026 MiLB draft at Pick #15 is an urgent opportunity to begin restocking. This system needs investment, not another round of asset liquidation.</p>

  <p><strong>Call-Up Timeline:</strong> Gilbert is the only realistic 2026 contributor — watch for an April or May activation window if he impresses in spring training. Payne is a 2028-2029 proposition at minimum. Ornelas and Lin are multi-year question marks. SEA's in-season roster management will depend almost entirely on the FA auction and the waiver wire, not anything percolating from below.</p>

  <p>This section carries a different urgency than it does for most teams. Jordan doesn't just have drop candidates — he has an <em>existential imperative</em> to release players before March 22. With $0 in auction budget, every player retained is a dollar withheld from the most important roster-construction event of the year. The question isn't whether to drop; it's who and how many.</p>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Zach Eflin, SP — $15 / Year 5 (→ $20 in 2027)</strong><br>This is not a debate. Eflin appeared in 14 games in 2025 and produced 124 FPts on an injury-shortened season — below the threshold of meaningful contribution at any price point, let alone $15. He's entering Year 5, which means a $20 cost next winter for a pitcher who may or may not be healthy enough to deliver rotation-quality production. Dropping Eflin is the first domino and the most obvious one. It should already be done. If it isn't, it needs to be done before anything else is discussed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Pete Fairbanks, RP — $20 / Year 3 (→ $25 in 2027)</strong><br>The hardest call on the roster, but arguably the most consequential. Fairbanks delivered average reliever production — 319.5 FPts at 5.24 FPts/G — at a salary that no longer reflects the relative value of relief pitching in this market. Twenty dollars for an average reliever heading toward $25 next year is a contract structure that gets worse with time, not better. The free agent pool has quality relief options available at auction. Dropping Fairbanks unlocks $20 in budget and adds flexibility that this team desperately needs. The dynasty value case for a 30-year-old reliever is thin at best.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Jeremy Pena, SS — $15 / Year 5 (→ $20 in 2027)</strong><br>Average production at shortstop — 403.5 FPts across 125 games — heading into a Year 6 price of $20 next winter. The confirmed FA pool includes legitimate SS options: Willy Adames (445.5 FPts, healthy), Dansby Swanson (409 FPts), and Carlos Correa (320.5 FPts) are all available. If Jordan can acquire a comparable or superior shortstop at the FA auction for $15-25, Pena becomes redundant overhead with a deteriorating salary trajectory. The math favors a release.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Mitch Keller, SP — $15 / Year 4 (→ $20 in 2027)</strong><br>308 FPts across 32 starts is below the threshold of a reliable TSDL starting pitcher at $15. With Webb, Peralta, Yamamoto, Abbott, and Lodolo already in the rotation, Keller is the sixth starter on a five-man staff at a non-trivial price. There's no compelling argument for retaining a below-average rotation arm at $15 when the FA auction could deliver better options at comparable cost. His value — if any — is as a trade chip in a deadline deal, not a 2026 roster fixture.</p>
  </div>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">The math is clean: dropping Eflin, Fairbanks, and Pena opens $50 in auction budget. Add Keller and you're at $65. That's the difference between watching the auction from the sidelines and actually competing for the players who will define the 2026 season.</blockquote>

  <p>Note also that <strong>Trevor Story</strong> ($18/Year 4) appears on the league's speculation radar as a potential release from Seattle. Story's $5 FAAB origin story makes his $18 retention feel generous by comparison — but his 465-FPt production across 157 full-season games at SS is legitimate above-average value, and the dynasty case for keeping him through Year 4 is defensible. He stays unless Jordan needs one final push on budget. But the fact that the rest of the league is watching this contract closely should tell Jordan something.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Auction Strategy</span>
  <h2>Free Agent Auction Strategy</h2>

  <p>The baseline reality before strategy can be discussed: the 2026 FA auction table seats 18 teams, and Seattle currently has a reservation with no money to spend inside. The scenario below assumes Jordan follows rational self-interest — dropping Eflin ($15) and Fairbanks ($20) at minimum, yielding $35 in reclaimed budget. Adding Pena ($15) gets to $50. Keller ($15) pushes it to $65. Plan around $50–65 as the realistic working range.</p>

  <p>The league budget landscape is punishing for Jordan at any number below $80. Philadelphia ($199), Toronto ($185), and Chicago ($167) will be spending with reckless abandon. Atlanta ($135), Boston ($165), and Washington ($129) all have meaningful reserves. Even Arizona ($34) and St. Louis ($51) have more flexibility than SEA at current construction. Jordan is not going to outbid the field for Shohei Ohtani (680.5 FPts, healthy, enormous dynasty value) or Juan Soto (661.5 FPts). Accept this premise and build around it.</p>

  <p>The strategic path for Seattle is surgical, not sweeping. Jordan already has one of the best rotations in the league, a legitimate top-five outfielder in Crow-Armstrong, and proven depth at the SS position. He doesn't need to rebuild — he needs to patch specific holes with precision. The holes are identifiable: third base (no qualified option post-Hayes), catcher (Bailey and Smith both gone), and offensive depth behind the top five hitters.</p>

  <p><strong>Primary Target — Third Base:</strong> <strong>Rafael Devers</strong> leads the confirmed FA pool at the position — 522 FPts in 2025, healthy, and a long-term dynasty asset of genuine quality. Devers will draw fierce competition from the budget-flush teams in the upper tiers of the spending table. A bid of $55–70 is warranted if Jordan has the funds; anything less risks losing him to Philadelphia or Toronto. The alternative: <strong>Matt Chapman</strong> (360 FPts) is acquirable in the $15–25 range for an above-average season at a position of clear need.</p>

  <p><strong>Primary Target — Catcher:</strong> The confirmed FA pool offers <strong>Yainer Diaz</strong> (327.5 FPts, C-eligible) as an attractive option with a realistic bid in the $20–30 range. <strong>J.T. Realmuto</strong> (295.5 FPts) is another quality target at $25–35. <strong>Dillon Dingler</strong> (273 FPts) provides a budget-friendly fallback at $10–15. With no catcher on the active roster, this is a must-fill position regardless of how many other cuts are made.</p>

  <p><strong>Secondary Priority — Outfield Depth:</strong> <strong>Brandon Marsh</strong> and <strong>Jeremiah Jackson</strong> represent the weak end of the outfield depth chart — Marsh at $2 is serviceable, Jackson at $2 is thin. From the confirmed FA pool, <strong>Christian Yelich</strong> (462.5 FPts, OF-eligible, healthy) is a quality target in the $20–30 range who will draw less competition than the elite names at the top. <strong>Bryan Reynolds</strong> (358.5 FPts) provides a cheaper alternative at $15–20.</p>

  <p><strong>Supplemental Monitoring from the Likely Cuts List:</strong> Several players currently held by other teams are plausible late additions to the FA pool. <strong>Jose Ramirez</strong> ($71/Year 5 at San Diego) and <strong>Matt Olson</strong> ($47/Year 5 at Houston) are aging stars at salary pressure points — if cut, they would represent premium auction targets but at prices Jordan can't afford in an underfunded budget scenario. More realistic: <strong>Jose Berrios</strong> from Texas (Year 3 SP) and <strong>Maikel Garcia</strong> from Washington (Year 3 utility) are names worth tracking if budget constraints squeeze them loose. Worth noting: Seattle's own <strong>Pete Fairbanks</strong> and <strong>Zach Eflin</strong> also appear on this list — which is the league's polite way of confirming what Jordan should already know.</p>

  <p>The optimal $60–65 budget allocation: $35–45 on a 3B (Devers if winnable, Chapman as the fallback), $20–30 on a catcher (Diaz or Realmuto), and $5–10 in reserve flexibility for opportunistic adds. The bold alternative that's worth considering: bid $60+ on Devers, skip everything else, and solve the rest in-season. Devers immediately fixes the 3B gap and adds a legitimate dynasty asset — a trade-in for Hayes that qualitatively exceeds what was lost.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Draft</span>
  <h2>MiLB Draft Outlook</h2>

  <p>Seattle drafts at Pick #15 in the 2026 MiLB slow draft — a late-first position that won't yield the consensus top-10 prospects being scooped up by rebuilding teams at the top of the board, but one that offers real value for an organization that knows what it needs and does the research.</p>

  <p>The 2025 draft class was systematically dismantled in service of the playoff push — seven new picks, six of whom were traded. The lesson embedded in that history is that Jordan uses farm assets as trade currency, which means the 2026 draft should prioritize players with enough dynasty value to make excellent chips <em>or</em> enough ceiling to be worth holding through the development process. Ideally both.</p>

  <p>The draft priorities for 2026 should be structured around three considerations. First: a high-ceiling pitching prospect — preferably consensus-ranked in the 20-40 range if one falls to #15. Jordan has proven the willingness to move MiLB arms as trade chips, and a great major league staff means development pressure is low. An arm worth holding can also become a premium trade piece at the 2026 deadline. Second: a corner bat or catcher prospect — 3B/1B/C upside would directly address the roster's weakest positions and build pipeline depth behind whatever auction additions Jordan makes. Third: resist the temptation to use the 2026 draft class as another chip-feeding exercise in service of a 2026 win-now push. The system is depleted. At least one pick from this draft needs to stay.</p>

  <p>The March 15 call-up deadline is approaching. <strong>Drew Gilbert</strong> is the only current MiLB player with a realistic shot at early-season activation. If promoted before the deadline, he becomes a cheap outfield contributor; if not, he's a mid-season target. Either way, this organization's in-season competitiveness rests almost entirely on what happens at the FA auction — not on what's developing below.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Verdict</span>
  <h2>2026 Season Prediction</h2>

  <p>Here is the unvarnished assessment: the Seattle Mariners are a genuinely great fantasy baseball team being partially held hostage by their own accumulated ambition. The pitching rotation of Webb, Peralta, Yamamoto, and Abbott is among the three best staffs in the TSDL. Yamamoto and Abbott at a combined $9 in keeper cost may be the most underpriced starting pair in the league. Pete Crow-Armstrong is entering his prime years at $5. The foundational talent here is undeniable and, in places, historically good value.</p>

  <p>But $0 in auction budget is not a strategic position — it's a structural emergency that requires resolution before March 22. The teams that win TSDL championships are typically the ones that enter the FA auction with $80–150 and deploy it ruthlessly against specific positional weaknesses. Jordan is being asked to compete for a title while sitting out the year's most important roster event unless he takes action first.</p>

  <p>The floor scenario: Jordan makes minimal cuts — $15 freed, one piece added — wins 11–12 games on the strength of the pitching staff, makes the playoffs as a 5th or 6th seed, and loses in the first round. The offense is structurally thin in spots that never get addressed. Third base remains a hole. Catcher remains a hole. The rotation carries a team that it shouldn't have to carry alone, and the season ends with another "so close" finish that feels further away than the record suggests.</p>

  <p>The ceiling scenario: Jordan makes three or four decisive cuts — Eflin, Fairbanks, Pena, possibly Keller — enters the auction with $60–70, wins a competitive bid on Devers or a comparable 3B, fills the catcher hole with a quality option, and enters the regular season with a legitimate lineup operating behind the league's best rotation. This ceiling is genuine: a 14–5 record, a top-2 seed, and a deep playoff run are all within reach if the roster construction comes together.</p>

  <div class="prediction-box">
    <p><strong>Projected Record:</strong> 10–9 (floor) to 14–5 (ceiling)</p>
    <p><strong>Playoff Probability:</strong> 80% — this rotation almost guarantees a playoff-level floor regardless of roster decisions elsewhere</p>
    <p><strong>Championship Odds:</strong> Top-3 contender if Jordan makes the right cuts; Top-6 fringe if he doesn't</p>
    <p><strong>Ceiling:</strong> Championship contender — the rotation is good enough to carry a title if the lineup gets meaningfully upgraded</p>
    <p><strong>Floor:</strong> A roster-locked 5th seed that watches the auction from the sidelines and finishes the season wondering what might have been</p>
    <p>The 2026 Mariners will be defined not by what happens in the regular season — they're too well-constructed to miss the playoffs — but by what Jordan Britton does in the next three weeks. Drop the deadweight. Free the dollars. Spend them with precision on March 22. There is no championship ceiling on a team with Yamamoto at $5, Abbott at $4, and Webb anchoring the top of the rotation. But there is absolutely a title floor if the man building this roster lets the fear of losing known commodities prevent him from acquiring the unknown ones that could make the difference.</p>
    <p><strong>The bottom line: Jordan Britton has assembled one of the best rotations in TSDL history. Now he has to be willing to use a scalpel on the rest of the roster to give that staff a lineup worth pitching for.</strong></p>
