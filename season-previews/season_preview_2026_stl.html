  <span class="section-kicker">Overview</span>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Forty-one and a half points. That is the margin separating <strong>Sam Crotto & Brian Baker</strong> and the <strong>St. Louis Cardinals</strong> from a TSDL championship banner. In the 2025 title game, Arizona rolled in as the tournament's Cinderella — an eighth seed who had no business being there — and escaped with a 577.5-to-536 championship win that left the Cardinals, the fourth seed and arguably the league's best team over the final two months of the regular season, staring at the scoreboard in disbelief. Some losses teach you nothing. This one was instructive: the Cardinals have the pieces to win it all. They came within a bad week from history. The question heading into 2026 is whether they can stay in that window long enough to finally break through.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Consider what Crotto & Baker have built in just three seasons. In 2023 they went 9-10 and finished 10th. In 2024 they collapsed to 7-11, bottoming out at 15th in an 18-team league. Most managers would have retreated into a rebuild. Crotto & Baker instead went all-in. They spent their 2025 FA auction budget aggressively, made five trades between May and July that fundamentally transformed the roster, and rode a rebuilt lineup and rotation to the best record in the second half of the season. The Cardinals finished 13-6, won the Smalls Award for 1,171 cumulative points through the early weeks of the season, knocked out fifth-seeded San Diego in the divisional round by 197 points, then beat third-seeded Seattle by 50 in the LCS before the Arizona ambush stole the ending.</p>

  <p>The story of 2026 is a franchise at a crossroads — not in the sense of rebuilding, but in the harder sense of sustaining. The core is genuinely excellent. The rotation is the envy of the league. But the farm has been stripped to the bone by deadline-chasing trades, the auction budget is squeezed to just $46, and at least one glaring positional hole on the active roster threatens to cost this team wins it should bank. Baker & Crotto have proven they can build a contender. Now they have to prove they can keep one running.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Season Recap</span>
  <h2>2025 In-Season Moves</h2>

  <p>To understand how the Cardinals got to runner-up status, you have to start in the spring — specifically, with the 2025 MiLB slow draft, where Crotto & Baker used their organizational depth as currency for a future championship run, then depleted that same depth through the summer to chase the present.</p>

  <p><strong>MiLB Draft (Spring 2025):</strong> Armed with the 4th overall pick, Crotto & Baker struck immediately, selecting <strong>Chase Burns</strong> in the first round. Burns — a high-upside righthander — was the prize of the draft class and a statement pick. Rounds two and three brought <strong>Trey Yesavage</strong> and <strong>Jonah Tong</strong>, adding two more pitching-heavy arms to what was already a deep minor league system. Beyond those three new additions, St. Louis retained seven players from the prior year's farm roster — <strong>Miguel Bleis</strong>, <strong>Orelvis Martinez</strong>, <strong>Luisangel Acuna</strong>, <strong>Dalton Rushing</strong>, <strong>Rhett Lowder</strong>, <strong>Dylan Lesko</strong>, and <strong>Cade Horton</strong> — giving them a 10-player minor league roster brimming with upside entering the season. On paper, it was one of the better farm systems in the league.</p>

  <p><strong>FA Auction:</strong> The 2025 FA Auction was where Crotto & Baker made their boldest declaration of intent. They spent $164 on six players, headlined by a <strong>$87 bid on Corbin Burnes</strong> — a massive swing at one of the game's most coveted pitching arms. He paired that with a <strong>$40 winning bid on Fernando Tatis Jr.</strong> and <strong>$23 on Rhys Hoskins</strong> to round out the corps. The Tatis acquisition looked brilliant from day one, and still does. The Burnes and Hoskins gambles did not pan out — neither player appears among the team's top performers from 2025, and Burnes was eventually dropped following mid-season Tommy John surgery, making the $87 investment one of the costliest write-offs of the 2026 season. The remaining $4 went to spot pickups: Ryan O'Hearn and Lars Nootbaar at a combined $3. When your marquee bid disappears and you still finish runner-up, you can call it a net positive. But the ghost of that $87 lingers.</p>

  <p><strong>In-Season Trades:</strong> This is where the real story lives. Between May and July, Crotto & Baker made five trades that transformed this team from an auction-splasher into a legitimate title threat — at a steep cost to the farm system they'd assembled.</p>

  <p>It started quietly in mid-May with a pair of Toronto Blue Jays deals — first swapping <strong>Luis Ortiz</strong> for <strong>Dylan Moore</strong> (a minor move), then flipping <strong>Ryan O'Hearn</strong> for <strong>Matthew Boyd</strong> at a straight $2-for-$2 salary swap. Boyd, at $5 in 2026 on a Year 3 deal, turned into one of the best values on the roster. The real fireworks started June 20th, when the Cards sent <strong>Hunter Gaddis</strong>, top prospect <strong>Cade Horton</strong>, and <strong>Isaac Paredes</strong> ($13, Year 3) to Chicago for <strong>Kyle Schwarber</strong> ($35, Year 1) and <strong>Carlos Estevez</strong> ($2, Year 1). Giving up Horton — a legitimate top-tier minor league arm — stung, but Schwarber delivered 621.5 FPts across 162 games, and Estevez quietly saved the season with 430 FPts in a closing role.</p>

  <p>Three days later, Milwaukee became the next trading partner: <strong>Jonah Tong</strong> and <strong>Quinn Priester</strong> (a combined $1 in prospect salary) headed north in exchange for <strong>Max Fried</strong> ($35, Year 4). Fried was one of the best starters available at the deadline, and his 561.5 FPts over 32 games justified every penny. Finally, on July 2nd, Crotto and Baker sent <strong>Trey Yesavage</strong> and <strong>Rhett Lowder</strong> — both $0 MiLB contract players — to Miami for <strong>Robbie Ray</strong> ($2, Year 2). Ray returned 426 FPts and became one of the better trade-acquired pitchers in the league that summer, though Yesavage comes into 2026 with his own buzz surrounding him that's sure to hurt Cardinals fans as they watch him produce for a competitor.</p>

  <p>In total, Crotto & Baker surrendered Horton, Tong, Priester, Yesavage, and Lowder — five prospects, four of whom were drafted or held with serious long-term upside in mind. The farm went from top-10 depth to a much thinner operation. And this team won 11 of its final 13 regular season games. You can debate the strategy. You cannot debate the result.

  <span class="section-kicker">Season Analysis</span>
  <h2>2025 Season in Review</h2>

  <p>The Cardinals' 2025 season was not a straight line. They opened 0-1, barely above water at 2-3 through five weeks, and were sitting at 3-4 after a Week 7 loss to Seattle. The team that would eventually reach the championship game looked, at the midpoint of summer, like another middling squad going nowhere. Then something clicked.</p>

  <p>From Week 8 through the end of the regular season, the Cardinals were one of the hottest teams in the league. They went 10-2 over their final twelve matchups, averaging better than 4.5 points per player per game during that stretch. The trades drove it — each acquisition layered in production, and by late July the lineup and rotation were clicking in sync. Their best week of the regular season came in Week 16, a 442-point demolition of Cincinnati that was one of the higher single-week totals in the league all year. Their worst outing was a 217.5-point performance in Week 4 against Arizona — an ominous preview of the team that would eventually deny them a title.</p>

  <div class="stat-grid">
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Total FPts (All Games):</strong> 8,049.5 — above league average (6,683.4)</div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>FPts/Game:</strong> 4.3 — one of the best rates in the league</div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Hitting FPts:</strong> 4,270.5 (266 HR, 782 RBI, 98 SB)</div>
    <div class="stat-grid-item"><strong>Pitching FPts:</strong> 3,779.0 (1,446 IP, 96 W, 76 SV, 1,554 K)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The postseason run was its own movie. A first-round matchup with fifth-seeded San Diego looked like a potential trap — the Padres entered as one of the league's highest-salaried teams. Instead the Cardinals buried them 714-517 over the two-week divisional series, a margin of 197 points that ranked among the most decisive playoff wins in recent league history. The conference round against third-seeded Seattle was tighter — a 614-564 victory that required production from top to bottom of the roster. Then came Arizona.</p>

  <p>The championship series result stings because it was so close and so surprising. Arizona entered as the eighth seed, a team that barely scratched into the playoff field. The Cardinals had been the better team all season by almost any measure — higher FPts total, better head-to-head competition, deeper roster. But two weeks of fantasy baseball are a coin flip, and the 8th seed flipped right. The final score — 577.5 to 536 — was a 41.5-point loss. Different injury luck, one extra save, two extra home runs, and the Cardinals hoist the trophy. That's the cruelest thing about dynasty leagues: the near-misses don't go away.</p>

  <p>On the individual side, the best in-season addition was <strong>Drew Rasmussen</strong>, acquired via a $8 FAAB bid and contributing 378.5 FPts at 12.2 per game across 31 appearances. He remains on the 2026 roster at just $2. That's the kind of low-cost steal that wins championships — and nearly did.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Offseason</span>
  <h2>Offseason Roster Cuts</h2>

  <p>Crotto & Baker trimmed six players heading into 2026, and the moves are a mix of the obvious and the eyebrow-raising.</p>

  <p><strong>Christian Walker</strong> (1B, $10/Year 4 → $15 in 2026): This one is painful but defensible. Walker produced 371.5 FPts across 154 games — reliable production, no complaints. But at $15 for a Year 5 contract next season, the escalation math had started to look punishing for a first baseman in his mid-thirties. Crotto needed the roster flexibility, and $15 spent on Walker is $15 not available for auction reinforcements. The right call, even if it hurts.</p>

  <p><strong>Rhys Hoskins</strong> (1B, $23/Year 1 → $24 in 2026): The Hoskins cut is essentially a financial acknowledgment of the auction's biggest miss. Acquired for $23 at the 2025 FA Auction, Hoskins returned just 189.5 FPts — one of the worst dollar-for-dollar returns of any significant investment in the league last season. He was never going to be kept at any price after that performance.</p>

  <p><strong>Jeff McNeil</strong> (2B/OF, $2/Year 1 → $3 in 2026): This is the cut that deserves the most scrutiny. McNeil produced 295.5 FPts and would have cost just $3 in 2026 — still on a Year 2 contract with 2B and OF eligibility in tow. At $3, he solves a positional problem that the Cardinals will be staring at all auction week. Releasing a $3 infielder with multi-position eligibility when you have no 2B-eligible player on your active roster looks, in hindsight, like a decision Crotto may come to regret. The only charitable reading is that he was planning to upgrade at the position through the auction, which means he'd better do exactly that.</p>

  <p><strong>Jose Caballero</strong> ($8/Year 1 → $9 in 2026): Caballero put up 285 FPts, which was solid but not $9-per-year solid. Year 1 escalations are always the moment of truth for auction acquisitions, and this one failed the test.</p>

  <p><strong>Miguel Andujar</strong> and <strong>Jake Latz</strong> ($1 each, Year 1): Both were pure depth decisions — Andujar's 226.5 FPts and Latz's 193 FPts didn't merit roster spots in a rotation this competitive. Easy cuts, no regrets.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Roster Analysis</span>
  <h2>The Core — Returning Players</h2>

  <p>The Cardinals carry 19 active keepers into 2026 at a combined salary of $214, leaving $46 in FA Auction budget. The salary map tells a clear story: this roster is top-heavy in the best possible way — anchored by four elite producers at the top, supported by a rotation that is among the deepest and most cost-efficient in the league. The two expensive contracts (Fried at $40, Tatis at $41) are legitimate questions heading into Year 3 territory. Everything else is positioned for at least two more years of competitive value.</p>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Garrett Crochet</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP | 2026 Cost: $19 | Contract Year 3</div>
    <p>Crochet was the best pitcher in the St. Louis Cardinals system in 2025 and arguably one of the two or three best starters in the entire league, posting 637.5 FPts across 32 starts at 19.9 points per game. At $19 on a Year 3 deal, he remains a bargain — but the clock is ticking. Year 4 will cost $24, Year 5 will cost $29, and by Year 6 you're looking at $34 for a pitcher who, in real baseball terms, will be entering his later prime years. The window to enjoy elite Crochet production at manageable salary is now. Crotto & Bakershould be treating every 2025-era decision with Crochet's escalation math in the back of his mind.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Cal Raleigh</div>
    <div class="player-meta">C | 2026 Cost: $11 | Contract Year 4</div>
    <p>In what was perhaps the biggest surprise of the 2026 season, Raleigh became not only the best catcher in the MLB, but the argument could be made that he was the best player in all of fantasty baseball in 2025. Raleigh put up 622 FPts over 159 games — a remarkable workload for a backstop — at just $11 on a Year 4 contract. Even as costs escalate toward $16 in 2027, Raleigh's production at the catcher position makes him one of the most irreplaceable assets in the league. This is a cornerstone contract for as long as his production holds.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Kyle Schwarber</div>
    <div class="player-meta">UT | 2026 Cost: $36 | Contract Year 2</div>
    <p>Schwarber's 621.5 FPts across 162 games were a product of elite power and on-base production over a full season. The $36 Year 2 price tag is the highest on the roster, and it escalates to $39 next year. His utility eligibility doesn't help roster construction and the contract isn't a bargain, but for a player this reliable across a full year, it's not an overpay either. He is, plainly, worth every dollar of it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Fernando Tatis Jr.</div>
    <div class="player-meta">OF | 2026 Cost: $41 | Contract Year 2</div>
    <p>One clarification before the analysis: in TSDL, <strong>Tatis is eligible exclusively at outfield</strong> — his SS eligibility does not carry over in this format. That matters for lineup construction. As an outfielder, his 534.5 FPts and 3.45 per game numbers are solid, but at $41 he'll be the league's most expensive retained outfield slot by a wide margin. Year 3 escalation brings that to $44. At these prices, Tatis needs to be a 550+ FPts producer every single season to justify the commitment. 2025 was close. The contract leaves almost no margin for error.</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Max Fried</strong> ($40, Year 5) is the other premium contract and the one with the most scrutiny. At Year 5, the escalation continues at $5 per season, pushing toward $45 in 2027. Fried delivered 561.5 FPts across 32 starts in 2025, cementing himself as a true rotation ace. For a frontline starter, $40 is painful but justifiable. The concern is the long escalation horizon — at some point, likely within the next two seasons, the salary will outgrow the production tier. That's not today's problem, but it's a problem Baker & Crotto should be planning for now.</p>

  <p>Below the four premium contracts, the Cardinals have constructed one of the most efficient rotations in the league. <strong>Matthew Boyd</strong> ($5, Year 3) produced 456 FPts at 14.7 per game — one of the best per-dollar returns in the rotation at any price point. <strong>Robbie Ray</strong> ($5, Year 3) and <strong>Drew Rasmussen</strong> ($2, Year 2) were both trade and FAAB acquisitions who delivered starter production at essentially nothing. <strong>Lucas Giolito</strong> and <strong>Brandon Pfaadt</strong> (both $5, Year 3) provide mid-rotation depth. <strong>Chase Burns</strong> ($2, Year 2) made just 13 starts but flashed real upside in limited action. The rotation cost — exclusive of Fried and Crochet — totals just $29 for six functional starters. That is exceptional organizational depth.</p>

  <p>The position player picture is more complicated. <strong>Geraldo Perdomo</strong> ($11, Year 4) was fourth on the team in FPts with 584.5 over 161 games — every bit a dependable everyday shortstop. <strong>Jackson Chourio</strong> ($10, Year 4) and his 427.5 FPts give the Cards a young outfield core with multiple productive years ahead. <strong>Masyn Winn</strong> ($5, Year 3) provides shortstop depth but his production (305 FPts, 2.36/G) puts him at the lower end of acceptable for a position player at any salary. <strong>Jordan Westburg</strong> ($5, Year 3) missed significant time in 2025, managing 233 FPts across just 85 games, leaving questions about his durability that the team must answer before relying on him as the everyday 3B option, and those questions came before news that he will potentially miss significant time to start the 2026 season.</p>

  <p>The bullpen is thin. <strong>Carlos Estevez</strong> ($3, Year 2) was genuinely one of the best closer situations in the league last year at 430 FPts and 6.4 per game — elite production for a reliever. But counting on him to replicate those numbers is a big risk given his weak underlying numbers. <strong>Garrett Whitlock</strong> ($2, Year 2) contributed a reliable 285.5 FPts in a setup role. Beyond that two, the Cardinals are carrying zero additional bullpen arms on their active roster. That is a depth problem that the auction may need to address.</p>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">The Cardinals' rotation — five starters at $5 or less backing Crochet and Fried — is the best cost-to-production ratio of any pitching staff in the league. The position player construction, meanwhile, has a hole at second base large enough to drive a bus through.</blockquote>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Minors</span>
  <h2>Farm Report — Minor League Roster</h2>

  <p>The Cardinals' farm system was, at various points in 2025, one of the most impressive organizational depth charts in the TSDL. The trades depleted it significantly, but that's one of the purposes of having a strong farm and Baker & Crotto didn't hesitate to use their MiLB currency to make a run at a title that almost paid off. What remains is a thinner but still productive group — anchored by a prospect who may be knocking on the door of the active roster and filled out by a tier of developmental players with legitimate upside but real question marks about their timelines.</p>

  <p><strong>Luisangel Acuña</strong> (age 23) is the most important player in the farm system right now, and not just because of his prospect pedigree. Acuña actually appeared in 95 MLB games in 2025, accumulating 113.5 FPts — limited but real major-league production. He profiles as an infielder capable of multi-position coverage with his new team in Chicago. For a team that desperately lacks a 2B-eligible body on its active roster, Acuña's potential call-up is the organizational solution to the problem. If he develops 2B eligibility in fantasy and holds his own in 2026, St. Louis doesn't need to overpay at auction to solve the position. They need to call up the right player. Acuña is the most likely candidate to reach the active roster by the early season (April-May window) and should be the team's top priority for promotion. </p>

  <p><strong>Dalton Rushing</strong> (C, age 24) also saw real MLB action — 67 FPts across 53 games in 2025. At 24 behind one of the best catchers in the league, he's a long-term organizational depth piece rather than an imminent call-up. If Raleigh gets injured, Rushing is the emergency backup. Otherwise, he's a quality stash who can be promoted if conditions change. Potential timeline: mid-season or beyond.</p>

  <p><strong>Miguel Bleis</strong> (age 21) is the youngest and most raw of the group. His consensus top-350 prospect ranking reflects a player with genuine tools — particularly in center field — but development timelines for 21-year-olds tend to be optimistic. He is a long-term stash with an indefinite call-up window.</p>

  <p><strong>Dylan Lesko</strong> (age 22) is a pitching arm who ranks in the top 330 by one major prospect evaluation service. He pitched in the minors in 2025 without making an MLB impact, and his development as a starter makes him a 2027-at-earliest option for the active roster.</p>

  <p><strong>Orelvis Martinez</strong> (age 24) is the most puzzling piece of the farm — a player with some prospect buzz who hasn't yet translated in the upper minors. His age is working against a long developmental timeline, as is a previous PED suspension. If he breaks through in 2026, it's a pleasant surprise. If not, the organization will face roster decisions about his MiLB slot before long.</p>

  <p><strong>Potential 2026 Call-Up Timeline:</strong></p>
  <ul style="margin: 0 0 1.2em 1.5em; color: #222;">
    <li><strong>Before Auction (3/15):</strong> None projected</li>
    <li><strong>Early Season (April–May):</strong> Luisangel Acuña — most MLB-ready option, could fill a lineup need</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-Season:</strong> Dalton Rushing (if Raleigh misses time)</li>
    <li><strong>Long-Term Stash:</strong> Bleis, Lesko, Martinez</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Overall, this is a system significantly weakened by the 2025 trade deadline — Horton, Yesavage, Lowder, Tong, and Priester were all credible prospects who are now developing for other organizations. What's left has legitimate value, but the top of the system is gone. Farm Grade: <span class="grade">C+</span></p>

  <h2>Drop Watch — Pre-Auction Speculation</h2>

  <p>The Cardinals have one clear must-cut and a handful of decisions that are less obvious but worth examining before the March 22 auction deadline.</p>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Drew Thorpe — SP, $5/Year 3</strong><br>
    Thorpe was hurt for all of 2025. None. He carried a $5 Year 3 contract, accrued zero FPts across zero games, and now heads into 2026 with a Year 3 escalation clock running. In a world where $46 is your entire auction budget, a dead $5 contract is not an asset — it is five dollars that cannot be bid on Shohei Ohtani. Thorpe must be cut. There is no other reasonable interpretation of this situation. Cutting him brings the auction budget to $51, which isn't transformative and won't put them in the bidding for Ohtani, but every dollar matters when you're working with single-digit margins against teams spending $100-plus.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Masyn Winn — SS, $5/Year 3</strong><br>
    Winn produced 305 FPts in 2025 — 2.36 per game across 129 games. At a shortstop position where the league-wide replacement pool is deep, Winn's production rate sits below what you'd expect from a starting-caliber fantasy option at any salary. The Cardinals already carry <strong>Geraldo Perdomo</strong> as a legitimate everyday SS who produced nearly 280 more FPts than Winn last season. Two SS bodies when neither has 2B eligibility creates a structural lineup problem. If Crotto & Baker could deploy Winn's $5 elsewhere — say, on a 2B-eligible FA acquisition — the positional math improves dramatically. Winn is not a lock to be cut, but he is the player most likely to be sacrificed in the interest of roster architecture.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Lars Nootbaar — OF, $2/Year 2</strong><br>
    Nootbaar's 313.5 FPts across 135 games (2.32/G) makes him the weakest outfield contributor on the roster by production rate. At $2, he's a trivial cost — but he occupies an OF slot that could go to a higher-upside auction target. The calculus here depends entirely on what Crotto & Baker find at auction. If the OF market is thin, Nootbaar stays as functional depth. If the team thinks a superior option emerges at a price the team can afford, he's the obvious removal. Keep him in the maybe column pending auction strategy.</p>
  </div>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">Cutting Drew Thorpe is not a decision — it's a formality. A $5 keeper with zero 2025 production is five dollars that should be bidding on the 2026 free agent pool. Every day Thorpe stays on this roster is a dollar wasted.</blockquote>

  <span class="section-kicker">Auction Strategy</span>
  <h2>Free Agent Auction Strategy</h2>

  <p>Forty-six dollars. That is what Crotto & Baker are currently set to walk into the 2026 FA Auction with — assuming all 19 keepers are retained. If Thorpe is released (which he should be), that number climbs to $51. Either way, the Cardinals enter the auction positioned near the middle of the spending-power table, sitting 8th out of 18 teams by available budget. They are outgunned by Philadelphia ($199), Toronto ($185), Chicago ($167), Atlanta ($135), Washington ($129), and Cincinnati ($124), but they're spending power ahead of the six teams at or below budget parity.</p>

  <p>The strategic constraint is real: Crotto & Baker cannot win a bidding war for the top free agents. <strong>Shohei Ohtani</strong> (680.5 FPts, the most decorated free agent available) will likely command $100 or more from a team with deep pockets. <strong>Juan Soto</strong> (661.5 FPts) will draw similar interest. <strong>Rafael Devers</strong> (522 FPts, 3B eligibility) could realistically push $30-40 in a competitive room. None of these players are realistic targets for a $46-51 team that cannot afford to go all-in on one name and leave zero budget for the rest of the auction.</p>

  <p>The positional mandate is clear: <strong>second base is the Cardinal's most urgent need.</strong> The active roster has no 2B-eligible player — a gap left open by the Jeff McNeil cut — and plugging it through the auction is non-negotiable unless Luisangel Acuña is called up before March 15. The 2026 confirmed FA pool offers several credible options at the position:</p>

  <p><strong>Jose Altuve</strong> (2B, HOU, 435.5 FPts) is the clearest target — a proven high-volume producer whose production rate and 2B eligibility make him the perfect fix for the positional hole. A budget of $25-35 is realistic and appropriate; spending above $35 starts to crowd out other needs. <strong>Ozzie Albies</strong> (2B, ATL, 405 FPts) and <strong>Gleyber Torres</strong> (2B/SS, DET, 404.5 FPts) are credible alternatives at similar price ranges. <strong>Spencer Steer</strong> (1B/2B/3B/SS, CIN, 354.5 FPts) is the multi-position fallback option if the premium 2B names push above budget.</p>

  <p>Beyond 2B, the Cardinals need to add at least one bullpen arm. Estevez and Whitlock are quality pieces, but two relievers is dangerously thin for a 19-week season. The FA pool offers <strong>Robert Suarez</strong> (RP, SD, 436.5 FPts) as the highest-upside option, though his price will reflect his save production. <strong>Raisel Iglesias</strong> (RP, ATL, 353.5 FPts) and <strong>Devin Williams</strong> (RP, NYY, 300.5 FPts) are volume options at lower price points.</p>

  <p>On the speculative cut market: Cincinnati is almost certain to release <strong>Trea Turner</strong> ($48, Year 5) given their salary burden, and if Turner hits the open market, he brings coveted 2B/SS eligibility. The price could be steep even from a cut — expect bidding in the $25-40 range for a player of his track record. Seattle looks likely to shed <strong>Trevor Story</strong> ($18, Year 4) or <strong>Logan Webb</strong> ($61, Year 4) before auction day given their team-wide salary crisis ($281 keeper salary). If Webb hits the open market, he's a luxury the Cardinals can't fully afford but could pursue at $35-40 as a rotation addition — though pitching depth is not where this team should be spending its budget.</p>

  <p>The optimal auction strategy for St. Louis: allocate $30-35 on one legitimate 2B target, spend $8-12 on a bullpen arm, and use the remaining $4-8 on organizational depth (corner bats, a streamer SP, or a late-round roster filler). Do not undershoot. Unused auction budget is gone forever, and in a market where teams like Philadelphia and Toronto can outbid you 4-to-1 on premium players, the only way to compete is to spend precisely and shrewdly.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Draft</span>
  <h2>MiLB Draft Outlook</h2>

  <p>The Cardinals pick 17th in the 2026 MiLB slow draft — a reflection of their competitive status and a significant drop from the 4th overall pick they held a year ago. At 17, you're picking from what's left after the league's rebuilding teams and middle-tier rosters have already selected their preferred targets. There are no sure things at pick 17.</p>

  <p>With five open MiLB slots (10 maximum, 5 currently occupied), Crotto & Baker have the roster flexibility to build out the farm without constraints. The strategic question is what type of prospect to prioritize given the major league roster's composition. The active roster is pitching-heavy — Crochet, Fried, Boyd, Ray, Rasmussen, Giolito, Pfaadt, Burns, and potentially Thorpe's slot freed up represent nine pitching investments at the MLB level. Adding more arms to the farm doesn't address the team's positional gaps. The priority in this draft should be <strong>hitting prospects</strong> — particularly infield bats with multi-position eligibility upside and outfield prospects who could eventually challenge for Nootbaar's roster spot.</p>

  <p>At pick 17, realistic targets might include mid-tier position prospects in the 200-400 range of prospect rankings — players who won't be the headliners of the draft class but can develop into productive contributors over two-to-three years. The ideal draft-day outcome: one high-upside position prospect in the middle rounds and two or three developmental pieces in later selections. The farm replenishment begins here.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Verdict</span>
  <h2>2026 Season Prediction</h2>

  <div class="prediction-box">
    <p><strong>Projected Record:</strong> 11–8 to 13–6 | <strong>Projected Finish:</strong> Top 5 | <strong>Playoff Odds:</strong> 75%</p>
    <p>The St. Louis Cardinals are a real championship contender in 2026, full stop. The rotation — led by <strong>Garrett Crochet</strong> and <strong>Max Fried</strong> and backed by five cost-controlled arms — is the best in the TSDL on a dollars-per-production basis. <strong>Cal Raleigh</strong> is the league's best catcher and questions swirl as to whether he can replicate such a historic season. <strong>Geraldo Perdomo</strong> is a 580-FPt shortstop at $11. If <strong>Kyle Schwarber</strong> and <strong>Fernando Tatis Jr.</strong> repeat their 2025 production, this team scores enough points to win on most nights. The pieces are there.</p>
    <p>The ceiling scenario: Crotto & Baker solve the 2B hole through auction, Westburg comes back early and delivers 3/4 season of strong production, Acuña earns a call-up and provides flexible infield cover, and Crochet/Fried stay healthy through a full rotation slate. In that world, the Cardinals return to the Championship Series with unfinished business and a legitimate shot at the title they lost by 41 points in 2025. That is a real outcome, not a fantasy.</p>
    <p>The floor scenario: The 2B gap haunts lineup construction all season, the auction goes sideways with the tight budget, one of the premium contracts (Tatis or Fried) has an injury year, and the team slides to 9-10 — on the playoff bubble but not the force they were a year ago. At $214 in keeper salary with only $46 to spend, there is very little margin for error.</p>
    <p><strong>The bold take:</strong> Sam Crotto's 2025 championship run will be remembered not for falling short, but for demonstrating that a team can be rebuilt from 15th place in one calendar year. Whether the 2026 Cardinals cement that trajectory or expose its fragility depends almost entirely on what happens in the auction room on March 22. Spend every dollar wisely, Sam & Brian. The window is open. Arizona got lucky once. Lightning rarely strikes twice. <strong>Projected Final Rank: #4 of 18.</strong></p>
