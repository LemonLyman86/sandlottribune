    <h1>2026 TSDL Season Preview: Arizona Diamondbacks</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Joel Sherman &mdash; 2026-02-22 &mdash; Part 2 of 2</p>
  </div>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Roster</span>
  <h2>The Core — Returning Players</h2>

  <p>Twenty confirmed MLB keepers. A total 2026 salary of $226. A $34 free agent auction budget. Those three numbers define the shape of everything that follows — and they paint a picture of a franchise that has built extraordinary value at the top of the payroll while absorbing real cost pressure at the bottom. The salary map is, in many ways, a story of two rosters existing simultaneously: one that's a dynasty bargain of historic proportions, and one that's quietly becoming expensive.</p>

  <p>Start with the bargains, because they deserve to be celebrated.</p>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Paul Skenes</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2026 Cost: $5 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Contract Year 3 &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2025: 526.0 FPts, 16.4 FPts/G</div>
    <p>Paul Skenes produced 526.0 fantasy points across 32 starts in 2025 — 16.4 FPts per outing — and he is 23 years old. He enters Year 3 of his contract at $5, escalating to $10 next season and $15 the year after. That curve is among the most favorable escalation paths for any player at his level in this league. No rational argument exists that Skenes is being overpaid at any point across the next three seasons. He is one of the best starting pitchers in fantasy baseball, and Arizona has him under contract at a price most teams would pay for a borderline fourth starter.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Bryan Woo</div>
    <div class="player-meta">SP &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2026 Cost: $10 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Contract Year 4 &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2025: 554.0 FPts, 18.5 FPts/G</div>
    <p>Woo led the Arizona staff in production last season with 554.0 FPts in 30 starts — 18.5 FPts per outing, the highest rate on the entire team. He enters Year 4 at $10, heading to $15 in 2027 and $20 in 2028. For a starter who is genuinely among the best in the game, those numbers still represent significant value. Woo and Skenes form as formidable a 1-2 pitching combination as exists anywhere in the TSDL. Any team would sell farm assets for either one of them. Arizona has both.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Junior Caminero</div>
    <div class="player-meta">3B &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2026 Cost: $2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Contract Year 2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2025: 519.5 FPts, 3.4 FPts/G</div>
    <p>Junior Caminero posted 519.5 fantasy points across 154 games in a breakout 2025 campaign. He is entering 2026 at $2 — a number so low it borders on absurd. Even next year's escalation to $5 represents a massive bargain for a player of his caliber. He's 21 years old, playing at an elite level, with 3B eligibility at one of the most valuable positions on any roster. His dynasty ceiling is extraordinary, and the contract ensures Arizona controls that ceiling for years to come.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="player-card">
    <div class="player-name">Pete Alonso</div>
    <div class="player-meta">1B &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2026 Cost: $40 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Contract Year 5 &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2025: 535.0 FPts, 3.3 FPts/G</div>
    <p>Alonso delivered 535.0 FPts across a full 162-game season. The production is not in question — it's the trajectory. At $40 in Year 5, his path leads to $45, then $50. He generates 13.4 FPts per dollar today; that ratio only deteriorates as the salary climbs. He is not a drop candidate this offseason. He remains one of the more productive first basemen in the league. But Alonso is a ticking clock, and the conversation about when to move on will only get louder as the years pass.</p>
  </div>

  <blockquote class="pull-quote">"Skenes and Caminero. Two of the best players in fantasy baseball, combined keeper salary of $7. The Diamondbacks didn't get lucky building this — they identified value early and held it. That's what dynasty franchise management looks like."</blockquote>

  <p>The broader roster context fills in around those four players. <strong>George Springer</strong> ($30, Year 5) delivered 525.5 FPts across 140 games — a reliable OF anchor whose dynasty profile has thinned considerably with age, but whose production remains legitimate. At $30 he's manageable today; at $35 next season the math starts to tighten. <strong>Jesus Luzardo</strong> ($18, Year 5) gave the rotation 476.0 FPts in 32 starts — a steady third arm whose Year 5 contract will hit $23 in 2027. <strong>Salvador Perez</strong> ($18, Year 3) delivered 397.5 FPts at catcher, one of the more productive catchers in the TSDL at a position where scarcity always inflates value. <strong>Jhoan Duran</strong> ($15, Year 5) added 400.5 FPts primarily from the bullpen — valuable production at a price that will climb to $20 next year.</p>

  <p>Two young arms on this roster deserve explicit attention. <strong>Eury Perez</strong> ($10, Year 4) appeared in only 20 starts in 2025, producing 221.5 FPts — a truncated output that understates his ceiling considerably. He's a young pitcher with a legitimate ace profile, and at $10 in Year 4, the risk-reward calculus is heavily weighted toward patience. A full, healthy 2026 season from Perez transforms this rotation from very good to genuinely elite. If he's back at full strength, every opponent's matchup plan against Arizona gets harder. <strong>Cam Schlittler</strong> ($2, Year 2) appeared in only 14 starts but posted a 12.2 FPts/G rate — one of the better per-game figures among starters across the league in limited action. His dynasty ceiling is substantial for a 22-year-old pitcher at this price point.</p>

  <p>The middle tier — <strong>Taylor Ward</strong> ($5, Year 3, 461.5 FPts), <strong>Spencer Torkelson</strong> ($9, Year 2, 416.5 FPts), <strong>Brandon Lowe</strong> ($8, Year 3, 373.5 FPts) — provides an above-average floor across multiple positions. Ward in particular is quietly one of the best value contracts in the outfield; 461.5 FPts at $5 is the kind of efficiency that championship rosters are built around.</p>

  <p>One structural problem sits visibly on the salary chart: <strong>there is no shortstop on this roster</strong>. Not one SS-eligible player among 20 confirmed keepers. That's the most glaring roster construction flaw entering 2026, and it creates a clear mandate for the auction.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Minors</span>
  <h2>Farm Report</h2>

  <p>Farm Grade: <span class="grade">A</span></p>

  <p>The Arizona minor league system is one of the elite farm operations in the TSDL. Nine of ten MiLB slots are occupied, and the talent at the top of the system is legitimately exceptional — a rare combination of high-floor prospects, dynasty-caliber young talent, and MLB-ready contributors who blur the line between stash and active roster piece.</p>

  <p><strong>Samuel Basallo</strong> (C, 21) is the crown jewel, and it isn't particularly close. He carries a consensus top-10 prospect ranking among all eligible prospects in baseball — a catching talent of genuine rarity at that developmental stage. Catchers with that kind of prospect pedigree don't come along often, and they virtually never land in dynasty rosters at $0 salary. Basallo logged 55 FPts in 31 games in 2025 — a cup of coffee that was almost certainly managed around service-time considerations rather than developmental need. When he arrives in full, he doesn't just improve Arizona's catching situation; he potentially redefines it. The natural succession question — what happens to Salvador Perez's contract when Basallo is ready — will be one of the more interesting organizational decisions of the next two years.</p>

  <p><strong>Robby Snelling</strong> (SP, 22) carries a consensus top-38 prospect ranking — a legitimate top-40 starting pitcher prospect by the broadest measure of the scouting industry. At 22 with a full development season ahead, he's tracking toward meaningful MLB impact within the next two years. A top-40 arm at this age and position is not a throwaway stash — he's a genuine rotation piece in formation.</p>

  <p><strong>Braden Montgomery</strong> (OF, 22) is the most contested player in the system. One major scouting service has him as a top-20 prospect; another doesn't place him in the top 50. That gap is unusual and instructive — it suggests either a real developmental inflection point happening in real time, or a genuine scouting disagreement about how the tools translate. Arizona's Round 2 investment reflects organizational conviction in the bull case. Treat him as a high-ceiling, high-variance outfield prospect: the floor is uncertain, but the ceiling is franchise-defining if the optimistic read is correct.</p>

  <p><strong>Nick Kurtz</strong> is listed on the MiLB roster but has effectively graduated in every meaningful sense. He played 117 MLB games in 2025 and posted 428.5 FPts — production that exceeds most confirmed active roster players across the league. He's 22 years old, and the conversation about him is no longer about development. It's about when Arizona formalizes his MLB roster status. He is a Round 1 pick who arrived years ahead of schedule.</p>

  <p><strong>Kyle Manzardo</strong> (1B, 25) ran a similar trajectory, playing 142 games with 323.5 FPts in 2025. He's 25 now — the minor league stash window has effectively closed. Manzardo provides insurance at first base and, in a longer organizational view, represents the natural successor once the Alonso contract eventually becomes untenable.</p>

  <p><strong>Luke Keaschall</strong> (OF, 23) showed 168.5 FPts in 49 games without carrying a meaningful prospect ranking — a depth piece who may outperform organizational expectations. <strong>Alex Freeland</strong> (SP, 24) sits around consensus top-165 — a deep system arm with limited upside. <strong>Ben Joyce</strong> (RP, 25) is an arm that any evaluator would love to project: the raw stuff is genuinely elite, the track record is limited, and the injury history explains why. Five games in 2025. The potential is real. The risk is real. <strong>Emiliano Teodo</strong> (SP, 25) is a consensus top-390 stash — a lottery ticket in the bottom slot, held at zero cost.</p>

  <p><strong>Potential 2026 Call-Up Timeline:</strong></p>
  <ul style="margin: 0 0 1.2em 1.5em; color: #222; line-height: 2;">
    <li><strong>Pre-Auction (by 3/15):</strong> Nick Kurtz — MLB-ready, promotion is a formality</li>
    <li><strong>Early Season (April–May):</strong> Kyle Manzardo — 25 years old, minor league runway has ended</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-Season:</strong> Samuel Basallo — service-time management may target a second-half call-up</li>
    <li><strong>Late Season / 2027:</strong> Robby Snelling, Braden Montgomery</li>
    <li><strong>Long-Term Stashes:</strong> Alex Freeland, Ben Joyce, Emiliano Teodo</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This system earns its grade without hesitation. The ceiling is Basallo as a franchise catcher, Snelling as a rotation centerpiece, Montgomery as a power outfield threat — with Kurtz and Manzardo already producing at the MLB level. For a defending championship team to have this much organizational depth is not just fortunate; it's the product of multiple years of smart drafting and patient development. Whatever happens in the auction, the long-term picture here is bright.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Bubble Watch</span>
  <h2>Drop Watch — Pre-Auction Speculation</h2>

  <p>Arizona enters 2026 with 20 locked-in keepers at $226 total salary. Three of those names are worth scrutinizing before the March 22 auction closes, for different reasons and with different urgency. None of the players already released are part of this conversation — those decisions were already made and covered in Part 1.</p>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Shane Baz — SP | $12, Year 4 (&rarr; $17 next year)</strong><br>
    Baz logged 309.0 FPts across 31 starts in 2025 — a below-average contributor at the most competitive position in the TSDL. He's heading into Year 4 at $12, which escalates to $17 in 2027 and $22 in 2028. With Woo, Skenes, Luzardo, Perez, Bradley, Schlittler, and Morales all committed to varying degrees in the rotation, Baz occupies the most expendable spot in the staff. The dynasty upside here is limited; this is a player whose value is tied entirely to current-season production, and that production has not kept pace with his escalating contract. Dropping him frees $12 for the auction. For a team with $34 to spend, that is a meaningful number — and it comes at essentially no cost to the rotation's competitive ceiling.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Trevor Megill — RP | $17, Year 2 (&rarr; $20 next year)</strong><br>
    The most complicated conversation on this roster. Megill was the $2 FAAB steal of the year — 342.0 FPts at 6.8 FPts/G after April 17, genuinely excellent production from a reliever who had no business being on the waiver wire. But the $2 FAAB claim has now translated to a $17 keeper, and the question is whether the production was real or circumstantial. Relievers are notoriously volatile. Paying $17 for one who delivered results over half a season — but hasn't sustained them over a full year at this level — is a calculated risk. <strong>Jhoan Duran</strong> already costs $15 at the back of the bullpen. Does this roster need two relievers commanding $15-17? Dropping Megill returns the largest single sum of any available cut: $17 freed for the auction. The counterargument is simple: you watched him pitch, the results were real, and walking away from real results is how good teams become average ones. This is the hardest call on the roster.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="drop-item">
    <p><strong>Jurickson Profar — OF | $9, Year 3 (&rarr; $14 next year)</strong><br>
    Profar played 80 games and posted 276.5 FPts — an average outfielder buried four-deep on a position that already carries Springer, Ward, Cowser, and Marsee. He cost $1 on the waiver wire last season; he'll cost $9 this year and $14 next. The dynasty ceiling is nil. He's a serviceable player on a roster that doesn't have roster space for serviceable — it has space only for contributors. Dropping him returns $9 to the auction budget with effectively zero impact on the production floor, given how overstocked the outfield already is. This is the easiest decision of the three.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The math on combined cuts: releasing Baz, Megill, and Profar frees $38, raising Arizona's auction budget from $34 to $72. That transformation — from modest participant to legitimate bidder — is the single most important lever available to this franchise before the auction opens.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Auction Strategy</span>
  <h2>Free Agent Auction Strategy</h2>

  <p>With a confirmed $34 budget, Arizona heads into the 2026 FA Auction in an awkward middle position: better than the cap-strapped powers locked at the top of the standings — San Diego is at -$29, Seattle -$21, Houston -$10, New York at -$9 — but outgunned by the bottom-of-standings teams sitting on mountains of unspent capital. Philadelphia enters with $199. Toronto has $185. Chicago carries $167.</p>

  <p>The defending champions are not the richest team in the room. That's fine. The imperative isn't to outspend everyone — it's to spend what's available more intelligently than anyone else.</p>

  <p>The roster has one gap that cannot be ignored: <strong>there is no shortstop</strong>. No SS-eligible player on 20 keepers. This isn't a secondary concern or a depth issue — it's a zero at a premium position, and ignoring it heading into a full season is not a viable strategic choice. The free agent pool has the answers.</p>

  <p><strong>Primary Targets — Confirmed 2026 FA Pool:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Dansby Swanson (SS)</strong> posted 409.0 FPts in 2025 — a legitimate, proven starter at the exact position Arizona most needs. A bid of $15–20 would consume the bulk of a $34 budget but would directly address the most critical hole on the roster. This is the clearest target-need match in the confirmed pool. If Swanson is available and Nichols is working with $34 — or $72 after drops — winning the Swanson bid should be the singular auction priority.</p>

  <p><strong>Gleyber Torres (2B/SS)</strong> delivered 404.5 FPts with dual middle-infield eligibility. If Swanson moves out of reach, Torres is the natural fallback at a similar production level — and the 2B eligibility adds roster flexibility that straight SS coverage doesn't provide. Bid range: $12–18.</p>

  <p><strong>Oneil Cruz (SS)</strong> posted 353.0 FPts in 2025 with a dynasty upside that exceeds his current production. Power, speed, an elite arm, and a profile that consistently grades as one of the more exciting young shortstops in baseball. His floor is volatile; his ceiling is franchise-altering. At $12–18, the dynasty case is compelling even if the 2026 floor is uncertain.</p>

  <p><strong>Christian Yelich (OF)</strong> put up 462.5 FPts — a proven producer who represents a clear upgrade over the OF depth currently occupied by Profar, if that slot is vacated. Not a dynasty-oriented move, but a competitive-window move. Bid range: $15–20, more realistic at $12–18 given the budget.</p>

  <p><strong>Zack Wheeler (SP)</strong> delivered 446.5 FPts — a premium starter who becomes a target only if Baz is released and the drops have expanded the budget to a range where $15–22 is absorbable. With $34 confirmed, Wheeler is a stretch. With $72 after drops, he's a serious conversation.</p>

  <p><strong>Secondary Targets — Likely-Cut Speculation:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Devin Williams (RP)</strong> is already in the confirmed FA pool — he spent time in Arizona's bullpen in 2025 after the April trade with Philadelphia, so the organization knows exactly what they're getting. If Megill is dropped and the bullpen needs reinforcement, Williams at $10–15 is the most logical replacement with the added benefit of prior-year familiarity.</p>

  <p><strong>Jose Ramirez (3B)</strong> — San Diego carries him at $71 in Year 5, making him one of the most likely high-profile cuts in the league before the auction. If Ramirez hits the free agent pool, a bidding war involving every high-budget team will follow. Arizona can't win that war at $34. At $72 after drops, an aggressive $30–35 bid becomes at least conceivable — though the competition from Philadelphia ($199) and Toronto ($185) makes it a long shot regardless.</p>

  <p>The strategic summary: make the drops. Baz, Megill, and Profar collectively represent $38 in salary. Releasing all three doubles the effective auction budget. With $72, Arizona becomes a real participant for the best available shortstop in the pool — and comes out of March having fixed the roster's most obvious flaw while retaining the flexibility to add a second meaningful piece. With $34, the same shortstop costs the team its entire budget, with nothing left over for depth. The math argues loudly for aggressive pre-auction trimming.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">Draft Outlook</span>
  <h2>MiLB Draft Outlook</h2>

  <p>Draft position #18. Dead last. That's the price of winning the championship in the TSDL.</p>

  <p>Arizona enters the 2026 MiLB slow draft (March 15–22) with one open roster slot and the final pick in every round. The system is already stacked with nine occupied slots — Basallo, Snelling, Montgomery, Kurtz, Manzardo, Keaschall, Joyce, Freeland, and Teodo. The math is simple: one pick, last in line, choose carefully.</p>

  <p>With the 18th pick in each round, the premium names — the Basallos and Snellings of next year's pool — are long gone by the time the board reaches Arizona. What the 18th pick gets you is either a legitimate organizational depth piece who fits a genuine system need, or a lottery-ticket arm at the back of the board with real upside attached to real uncertainty.</p>

  <p>The system gap that mirrors the active roster gap: <strong>there is no SS or MI prospect in Arizona's MiLB system</strong>. The same position that's missing from the 20-man keeper list is also absent from nine minor league slots. Adding a 21–23 year-old shortstop or middle infield athlete — even as a multi-year developmental stash — begins building infrastructure toward a need that only gets more pressing with time. With the 18th pick, you're not finding a consensus top-50 prospect at the position; those players are gone. But you can find a projectable, tools-over-performance type who fits a genuine organizational need and costs nothing but the roster slot.</p>

  <p>Alternative: a high-upside pitching arm to add further depth to an already-deep system. Defensible in a vacuum, less urgent when the system already carries Snelling, Schlittler, Morales, and Joyce as pitching assets. The more pressing need is clear.</p>

  <p>The right call: take the best available player at the position you actually need. Don't add a sixth outfield stash to an already-crowded OF developmental pipeline when shortstop is a blank line on the organizational depth chart.</p>

  <span class="section-kicker">The Forecast</span>
  <h2>2026 Season Prediction</h2>

  <p>The 2026 Arizona Diamondbacks are a championship-caliber franchise defending a title with a loaded active roster, limited auction spending power, and a farm system that makes the long-term picture genuinely bright. The question isn't whether they belong in the playoff conversation — they do, and every opponent knows it. The question is whether a $34 auction budget can fill the one hole that stands between a competitive team and a truly dangerous one.</p>

  <p>If <strong>Paul Skenes</strong> and <strong>Bryan Woo</strong> are healthy and pitching to their 2025 form, this rotation is a top-three unit in the TSDL. If <strong>Eury Perez</strong> is back at full strength and delivering 28-30 starts, it becomes top-two — and Arizona's playoff matchup draw becomes a very different problem for every opponent they face. The offense is anchored by Alonso, Springer, and Caminero, all three of whom produced over 500 FPts last year. The farm system provides two MLB-ready contributors in Kurtz and Manzardo, both of whom could step onto the active roster with minimal disruption.</p>

  <p>The binding constraint is the gap at shortstop and the $34 that represents the entire solution budget. Teams with $100-200 in auction reserves are going to reshape their rosters dramatically in March. If Arizona doesn't make the drops and address the SS need directly, they enter Opening Day with a lineup flaw that becomes increasingly visible as the season progresses.</p>

  <div class="prediction-box">
    <p><strong>Projected Record:</strong> 11&ndash;8 to 12&ndash;7</p>
    <p><strong>Projected Playoff Seed:</strong> 4th&ndash;6th</p>
    <p><strong>Championship Ceiling:</strong> Genuine deep-run contender — the rotation wins playoff series</p>
